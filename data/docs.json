We measured the leaf area index (LAI), the light extinction coefficient (k) for Beer's law, N concentrations, and the harvest index (HI) for the main and ratoon crops in 1999 and 2000 at Eagle Lake, TX. Dry matter was linearly related to intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) for all of the data sets.

This review attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of N on crop biomass accumulation by elucidating quantitative relationships among leaf N content, CO\u2082 assimilation rate, and crop radiation use efficiency. Three crop species were considered: soybean (Glycine max [L.] Men.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and maize (Zea mays L.). The correlation between leaf N content and leaf CO\u2082 assimilation rates was high within each species, although the response functions were markedly different among species. A relationship was developed predicting crop radiation use efficiency (biomass accumulated per unit solar radiation intercepted) for each of the crops as a function of both leaf CO\u2082 assimilation rate and leaf N content. Radiation use efficiency within each species was nearly constant at high leaf CO\u2082 assimilation rates, but decreased appreciably at low leaf CO\u2082 assimilation rates. At the leaf CO\u2082 assimilation rates typical of a species, the radiation use efficiency was predicted to be about 1.2 g MJ\u207b\u00b9 for soybean, 1.4 g MJ\u207b\u00b9 for rice, and 1.7 g MJ\u207b\u00b9 for maize. Simple calculations during early crop growth examined the competitive use of N for the construction of either large leaf area or high leaf N content.

Highly significant varietal differences were found at both stations by the analysis of variance. Rates of seeding varying from 60 to 120 pounds per acre did not affect the yields. At Crowley the plats with 6-inch intervals between rows gave significantly higher acre yields than did plats with wider spacings. On more fertile soil at Beaumont spacing the rows from 6 to 12 inches apart did not influence acre yields. Where the yields of nursery plats, grown in rows spaced 12 inches apart, are consistently lower than those of the same varieties grown in field plats, the results at Crowley indicate that by allowing less space between the rows and by harvesting a larger proportion of the plat the nursery yield may be increased. This practice, however, would require more labor in seeding, harvesting, and threshing, and would make roguing more difficult. Since none of the interactions was significant at either station, it appears that the varietal differences were expressed equally over the full range of seeding rates and spacings. Coefficients of variability show that at Crowley the three-row plats with a 12-inch row spacing and with only the one center row harvested were slightly more variable than were plats of the same or similar size in which the rows were spaced more closely and two to four of the inside rows were harvested.

Traditional practice of applying entire dose of N fertilizer during sowing causes its low recovery. Nonetheless, it does not sustain over subsequent growth of rice, mainly due to uncontrolled waterlogged situation. Green manuring along with chemical N application was reported as advantageous ensuring sustained availability of adequate N over the period. A field study on green manuring rice under rainfed lowland situation was conducted during wet seasons in 2001 to 2004 in the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, India. The photosensitive, tall and long-duration rice variety, Durga was grown along with green gram (Phaseolus radiatus) for green manuring under three mixed cropping stands, that is, additive system, replacement system, and broadcast-sown stands. Green gram, also known as mung bean, is a widely grown pulse crop. As a leguminous crop, it is capable of contributing considerable amount of green matter and N into the soil. Thus it can be used for green manuring to facilitate N nutrition to the rice grown in its association. Rice was sown at 15 x 20 cm spacing (plant x row), except in broadcast-sown stands where rice and green gram seeds were mixed thoroughly before sowing and broadcasted evenly without maintaining any plant/row arrangement. In the additive system, one row of green gram was intercropped after every two consecutive rice rows, when usual row spacing was changed therein. Thus the adjacent rice rows were 10 cm apart from green gram row. In the replacement system, one rice row after every two consecutive rice rows was replaced with one row of green gram without changing usual row spacing, that is, the adjacent rice rows were 20 cm apart from green gram row. These green-manured mixed stands were compared with two pure stands of rice, that is, rice grown with usual dose of 40 kg N/ha and rice grown without N. Similar management practices were followed for both the crops altogether and no additional fertilizers were applied in green gram. Growth dynamics of green gram as evidenced from its plant height and dry matter recorded at regular interval showed no variation over the years. It was incorporated into the soil at its flowering stage accumulating 7.00 to 25.60 kg N/ha over the years under different stands.

In weedy situations, the yield losses may ascend to 50\u201360% in puddled transplanted rice and 70\u201380% in DSR. Herbicidal weed management is the most widely adapted strategy, however, the large scale application of herbicides mainly of same or similar mode of action is constrained by the risks of environmental trade-offs, introduction of herbicide-resistance in different bio-types of weeds, non-selectivity and narrow-spectrum of herbicides. Hence, ecological approaches, like weed-competitive cultivars, alterations in seed rates, and planting patterns could be highly useful in reducing the weed menace. This review reveals that main characteristics imparting weed-competitiveness to rice include selection of cultivars, seedling vigour, early and faster establishment of seedlings, root-shoot characteristics, and self-supportive allelopathy. In DSR, a higher seeding rate of 50\u201360\u00a0kg\u00a0ha\u22121 has been found to reduce weed biomass by \u223c50%, without imposing any yield penalty and, thus desirable under weedy conditions.

This research investigated the impacts of plant population on grain yield and yield components for aerial- and drill-sown rice, and the effects of row-spacing width for drill-sown rice grown in a temperate environment. Ten aerial-sown and five drill-sown experiments were conducted in south-eastern Australia over three seasons using four semi-dwarf rice varieties. Plant populations ranged from 7 to 396 plants m-2. Plant populations as low as 30 plants m-2 were able to achieve grain yields >12 t ha-1 but only when the plants were uniformly distributed. At a population of ~100 plants m-2, the impact of plant-stand distribution was negligible. Grain yield was maintained across a large range of plant populations, mainly through compensatory effects of more tillers per plant and more grains per panicle at lower plant populations. For aerial-sown rice, maximum grain yield (up to 14.9 t ha-1) was always achieved with a minimum plant population of 100 plants m-2, and likewise for drill-sown rice provided the row spacing was \u226427 cm. At equivalent plant populations, 36-cm row spacing produced lower grain yield than narrower row spacings. When large gaps existed between plants within the rows, neighbouring plants could not compensate for the gap at the wider 36-cm row spacing, and grain yield was reduced.

Only in three cultivars was it warmer than 28 degrees C, and in these there were sufficient data to establish that relations between rates of progress to panicle emergence and photoperiod in the diurnally alternating temperature regime of 28-20 degrees C are also linear. Also, the responses of these three cultivars provide no evidence of any interaction between the effects of photoperiod and temperature. We conclude, then, that the model in which rate of development is a linear function of both temperature and photoperiod with no interaction, which has been shown to be common to many other species, also applies to rice. Differences among genotypes in relative sensitivity of rate of progress towards panicle emergence to both temperature and to photoperiod were considerable; japonica cultivars tended to be more sensitive to temperature and less sensitive to photoperiod than indica cultivars. Four indica cultivars bred and selected at The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines did not differ (P > 0.10) in their relations between rate of progress towards panicle emergence and sub-optimal temperatures in a daylength of 11.5 h, but the optimum temperature for cv.

Research was conducted to study phenological development rate, growth, yield, IPAR and radiation use efficiency of the winter maize under different photo-thermal environments and irrigation regimes, created by changing sowing dates and irrigation levels. The peak IPAR of 89.3, 87.6 and 85.5% were recorded by first, second and third sown crops, respectively and RUE of 1.55 to 2.02 g MJ were achieved under different treatments. Development rate was significantly correlated with maximum and minimum temperatures during emergence to tasseling and tasseling to maturity stages of the crop. Day length was found to be significantly correlated with reproductive stage of the crop but its effect on the phenology development rate in vegetative stage was not evident. Significant variation in biomass, leaf area, IPAR and RUE occurred among irrigation treatments. The last sown (January) crop expressed lower negative stress degree day (SDD) due to more dryness and less availability of soil moisture; as a result crop growth and productivity were reduced significantly."}, "7260767": {"title": "Cultivar selection can increase yield potential and resource use efficiency of spring maize to adapt to climate change in Northeast China", "abstract": "Northeast China (NEC) is one of the major maize production areas in China. Agro-climatic resources have obviously changed, which will seriously affect crop growth and development in this region. It is important to investigate the contribution of climate change adaptation measures to the yield and resource use efficiency to improve our understanding of how we can effectively ensure high yield and high efficiency in the future. In this study, we divided the study area into five accumulated temperature zones (ATZs) based on growing degree days (GDD). Based on the meteorological data, maize data (from agro-meteorological stations) and the validated APSIM-Maize Model, we first investigated the spatial distributions and temporal trends of maize potential yield of actual planted cultivars, and revealed the radiation use efficiency (RUE) and heat resource use efficiency (HUE) from 1981 to 2017. Then according to the potential growing seasons and actual growing seasons, we identified the utilization percentages of radiation (PR) resource and heat resource (PH) for each ATZ under potential production from 1981 to 2017. Finally, we quantified the contributions of cultivar changings to yield, PR and PH of maize. The results showed that during the past 37 years, the estimated mean potential yield of actual planted cultivars was 13 649 kg ha\u2013\u00b9, ranged from 11 205 to 15 257 kg ha\u2013\u00b9, and increased by 140 kg ha\u2013\u00b9 per decade.

While irrigated maize accounts for 58% of total annual maize production in the Western U.S. Corn Belt, current yield gap in these systems has not been quantified. Our objectives were to quantify YP, yield gaps, and the impact of agronomic practices on both parameters in irrigated maize systems of central Nebraska. The analysis was based on a 3-y database with field-specific values for yield, applied irrigation, and N fertilizer rate (n=777). YP was estimated using a maize simulation model in combination with actual and interpolated weather records and detailed data on crop management collected from a subset of fields (n=123). Yield gaps were estimated as the difference between actual yields and simulated YP for each field-year observation. Long-term simulation analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of YP to changes in selected management practices. Results showed that current irrigated maize systems are operating near the YP ceiling. Average actual yield ranged from 12.5 to 13.6Mgha\u00e2\u0081\u00bb\u00c2\u00b9 across years.

In 50 simulations of high-yield sites across China from 1990 to 2009, the yield potential averaged 16.5Mgha\u22121 for irrigated maize and 13.9Mgha\u22121 for rainfed maize, respectively.

In comparison, the average farmer's yield was 7.9Mgha\u22121 based on 5584 farms surveyed in 2007\u20132008. Consequently, the yield gap between the average farmer's yield and the modeled yield potential (YGM) was 8.6Mgha\u22121 for irrigated maize and 6.0Mgha\u22121 for rainfed maize and so farmers attained 48\u201356% of the yield potential. The yield gap between the average farmer's yield and highest recorded yield (YGR) was 7.6Mgha\u22121, so farmers attained 51% of the recorded yield.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and compare the profit potential of corn and grain sorghum in cover crop systems in Illinois. Literature SummaryMany scientists and corn producers have concluded that cropping systems with corn and cover crops are less profitable than corn/fallow cropping systems in the central USA. Grain sorghum may be a better summer grain crop for such cover crop systems with hairy vetch or rye. Grain sorghum requires less N and water for an economically optimal yield and can tolerate a later planting date without suffering a yield loss. Grain sorghum and cover crop systems have been shown to work in Georgia, but farmers and scientists have little experience or research information to predict the outcome of such a system in the central Corn Belt. Study DescriptionThis field study was conducted during 1991 and 1992 on three farms in Illinois. Treatments consisted of hairy vetch (25 lb seed/acre) and rye (150 lb seed/acre) cover crops as well as winter fallow. The cover crops were killed 1 week prior to the appropriate corn planting date for each site or about 2 wk later. Corn and grain sorghum were planted no-till and conventionally 1 wk after the cover crops were killed. Four rates of N fertilizer (0, 80, 160, 240 lb N/acre) were applied as a sidedress. Plots were harvested at maturity. Applied QuestionsDid delayed planting of corn and grain sorghum result in increased cover crop production and N content? Delayed planting did increase hairy vetch and rye production and N content, but decreased corn (128 vs. 106 bu/acre) and grain sorghum yield (94 vs. 89 bu/acre). Thus, planting of corn or grain sorghum should not be delayed in an effort to increase cover crop biomass or N content. Are cover crops profitable? Grain yield following rye was significantly less than either fallow or hairy vetch and thus less profitable (Fig. 1). At the economically optimal yield level, grain yield following hairy vetch was 3 bu/acre greater than when following fallow but not large enough to compensate for seed and planting costs of hairy vetch. At economically optimal yield levels, we calculated that hairy vetch contributed only 20 lb N/acre to the subsequent summer grain crops. Soil erosion was not measured in this study, but it is reasonable to assume that no-till or cover crop systems would decrease soil erosion substantially. Fig. 1The effect of N fertilizer on mean grain yield of a summer grain crop following either a hairy vetch or rye cover crop or fallow. Is grain sorghum preferable to corn in a cover crop system? Grain sorghum required less N than did corn for an economically optimal yield (180 vs. 108 lb N/acre) (Fig. 2), but grain sorghum yield was so much less than corn (132 vs. 98 bu/acre at the economically optimal yield) that it was not competitive with corn regardless of the N rate used. Thus, grain sorghum is not preferable to corn for profitable cover crop systems in the central Corn Belt.

However, the yields from farmers' fields have not been investigated yet. Yield gap analysis provides a framework to examine land productivity, i.e. the actual yields realized in farmers' fields versus the potential yields when a crop is grown with water and nutrients non-limiting and biotic stresses effectively controlled. In this research, we aim to define yield potentials and yield gaps in intercropping systems, and apply this to an irrigated wheat-maize relay intercrop in Gaotai county (Zhangye city), Gansu province in northwest China. Data from three field experiments (2010\u22122012) were used to calibrate and test crop models for two sole crops and an intercrop. Potential yields were estimated for five years (2010\u20132014) by model simulations, and actual yields were determined by surveys of 310 farm households in 2014. The main results are: 1) in sole crops, the potential yield of spring wheat is 7.3tha\u22121 and the potential yield of maize is 14.2tha\u22121; 2) in a wheat-maize relay intercrop with a land area ratio of 0.5 for each crop, the potential yield of wheat is 4.8tha\u22121 and that of maize is 12.0tha\u22121; 3) comparing the yield in the intercrop and the expected yield (i.e. the yields in sole crops multiplied by the land area ratio in the intercrop for each species), the intercropped wheat gained 32% under potential growing conditions and 67% under actual growing conditions; while the intercropped maize gained 69% under potential growing conditions and 64% under actual growing conditions; 4) farmers achieved 67% of potential yield for sole wheat, and 85% for intercropped wheat; however, farmers achieved only 51% of potential yield for sole maize and 49% for intercropped maize. The farm survey showed that wheat-maize relay intercropping is still widely used by farmers in Gaotai county, and farmers gained extra yield from wheat-maize relay intercropping compared to sole crops, but the gap between potential and actual yields is especially large for maize in this region. Water is likely to be the main limiting factor for maize production despite the irrigation. We conclude by exploring how grain production in Gaotai county would be affected by substituting intercrops by sole crops. We find that the grain production will decrease between 18% to 44% if all the farmers would replace wheat-maize relay intercropping by either wheat or maize sole crop compared to the current land use.

Subsequently, calibrated models were evaluated on their ability to simulate yield potential using an independent database available from variety (irrigated rice) and fertilizer (irrigated and rainfed maize) trials conducted at multiple site-years across major rice and maize producing areas in Indonesia. Calibrated coefficients for rice were robust at reproducing observed leaf area, aboveground biomass, and biomass partitioning to different plant organs.

Narrow row systems where corn and soybean are planted using the same narrow row spacing with the same planting equipment are compared with (i) a system where soybean are drilled and corn is planted in conventional, 76-cm rows (30-inches), and (ii) a system where the same equipment is used to plant corn and soybean in 76-cm rows. Sensitivity analyses consider net returns (i) to each system calculated at loan rates, (ii) to each system when glyphosate-resistant soybean are included in the production set, and (iii) taking into consideration regional price and plant response effects. Expected profits, equipment costs, and the economic risks involved in the choice between alternatives are quantified using partial budget analysis, a mean-variance criterion, stochastic dominance, and certainty equivalents. In all comparisons, strategies with narrow row soybean were always more profitable."}, "311229": {"title": "Maize Evapotranspiration and Water-Use Efficiency in Response to Row Spacing", "abstract": "Reduced row spacing has shown to increase maize (Zea mays L.) yield; however there are conflicting results on whether narrow rows increases maize crop evapotranspiration and/or water use efficiency. This work analyzes the response of maize yield, crop evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency to reduced row spacing under different water and N regimes. Maize crops were grown at Balcarce, Argentina, during two seasons. Treatments included two water regimes (rain-fed and irrigated), two rows spacing (35 and 70 cm) and two rates of N (i.e., 180 kg N ha\u207b\u00b9 or nonfertilized). Soil water content was measured through the growing seasons using a neutron probe, grain yield and shoot dry matter were determined at physiological maturity. Grain yield response to narrow rows ranged from 0 to 23%; it was higher for water limited (i.e., rain-fed crops) and/or N deficient crops (i.e., nonfertilized crops) and lower for crops with high N fertilization and irrigation. Narrow rows consistently increased (8%) crop ET during the initial stages of crop growth; and N fertilization did not influence ET response to reduced row spacing during this period. Initial differences in ET between row spacing treatments were diluted as the season progressed, and seasonal crop ET was not influenced by row spacing.

Field experiments were conducted in Argentina between 1997/1998 and 2000/2001. Four hybrids were grown at a wide range of plant populations (3, 9, 10 and 12 plants m-2), row spacings (0.35, 0.7 and 1 m) and pollination treatments (natural and restricted pollination). Senescence development was well described (r2=0.61-0.99,P<0.05) as a bilinear process, starting always at around 500 \u00b0C day (base temperature of 8 \u00b0C) before silking. Senescence progressed at a lower rate during the first phase of the process than during the second one (\u223c1.4 vs. \u223c5.5 cm2 per plant per \u00b0C per day). The second phase always started between silking and 400 \u00b0C day after silking. Increased plant population increased senescence rate during the whole plant cycle, but never affected the ontogenic stage when senescence was initiated or accelerated in all hybrids. Increased plant population promoted: (i) an enhanced light attenuation within the canopy (k coefficient=0.43, 0.55, 0.53 and 0.65 for 3, 9, 10 and 12 plants m-2, respectively), (ii) an augmented post-flowering source-sink ratio (11.6 cm2 of green plant leaf area per kernel at 9 and 12 plants m-2 compared to 8.3 cm2 per kernel at 3 plants m-2), and (iii) a decreased grain protein concentration. Senescence was reduced by kernel set restrictions that enhanced post-flowering assimilate availability, indicating the process was accelerated by assimilate starvation at high plant populations independently of the green leaf area established per growing kernel. Row spacing altered light quality (red:far-red ratio) perceived at the lowermost leaf stratum at the highest plant populations, but had no effect on senescence development.

The experimental design was a randomised complete block design in a 2\u00d72 factorial scheme, with eight replications. The treatments comprised two row spacing distances (0.45 and 0.90m) and two crop management types (maize monoculture and intercropped with palisade grass). The nutrient concentrations in the leaves of the maize plants were in the ideal range for this crop under all conditions studied. Plant height, height of first ear, and number of grains per ear were higher with the narrow row spacing. Maize grain yield was similar in both crop management types (10301 and 9745kgha-1 for monoculture maize and intercropped, respectively). However, maize grain yield at the narrow row spacing was higher than that obtained with the wide row spacing (9948 v. 8905kgha-1). In contrast, row spacing did not affect the nutrient level or quality (crude protein concentration) of palisade grass. The amount of dry matter (DM) from palisade grass was lower at maize harvesting (4.7Mgha-1) and 90 days after harvesting (6.9Mgha-1) under narrow spacing. However, the amount of DM was similar at both row spacings at 120 days after maize harvesting (9.2Mgha-1).

Within this period, we establish a critical period of ~30 days around silking (i.e. \u2013200 to 250 GDD after silking), in which KN susceptibility was maximal. The variation in KN during this period of 450 GDD was mainly accounted for by resource availability and not by timing of treatment imposition within this window. A direct relationship between KN and weight per kernel (KW) for shading treatments imposed from 0 to 200 GDD after silking indicated that compensation of KN reduction by KW increase might not be expected when stress occurred immediately after silking. Kernel number and KW presented an inverse relationship when shading took place after 200 GDD after silking. In addition, thinning after the onset of the effective grain-filling period increased KW. The results indicate that, even in the undisturbed crop, KW was limited by source capacity during grain filling. It is suggested that there is a need to reconsider current agronomic practices and breeding strategies, focusing on the source capacity during the grain-filling period."}, "308487": {"title": "Model Concepts to Express Genetic Differences in Maize Yield Components", "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield is closely related to kernel number per unit area.

Our objectives were to study the effect of the availability of endogenous and exogenous P on i) remobilization of endogenous seed P, ii) the beginning of exogenous P uptake and its intensity, iii) their interaction and effect on seedling development. METHODS: Seeds with high and low reserves of endogenous seed P were cultivated at three rates of availability of exogenous P (0, 100, 1,000\u00a0\u03bcM) over a growth period of 530 cumulated degree days after sowing. Exogenous P was labeled with radioactive P (32P) to distinguish the two fluxes of P in seedlings, one due to remobilization of seed P and the other to uptake of exogenous P. RESULTS: Initially, 86% of endogenous seed P was localized in the scutellum, mainly in the form of phytate, regardless of initial endogenous seed P. At 89 cumulated degree days after sowing (base temperature: 10\u00b0C), 98% of seed phytate was hydrolyzed in all treatments. In treatments with available exogenous P, significant uptake of exogenous P started at 71 cumulated degree days after sowing. Efficient uptake of exogenous P depended on its availability, but was independent of phytate hydrolysis and seedling P status. Significant loss of P from germinating seeds due to efflux was observed and was also independent of the availability of exogenous P. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that hydrolysis of seed P was not influenced by the availability of exogenous P, and conversely, that uptake of exogenous P was not influenced by endogenous P in the seed.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of planting date on early growth of sweet corn with different maturities for different environmental conditions in Georgia, USA. Three yellow sweet corn genotypes, including a full homozygous sugar enhanced (se), a super sweet (sh2), and a standard or normal (su), were compared in 2004, 2005, and 2006 in two locations in Georgia. The experiment consisted of one planting date in 2004, six in 2005, and four planting dates under two water regimes in 2006. Plant growth variables that were measured included leaf area index (LAI), canopy height, and aboveground biomass from emergence to the beginning of tasseling. The growth rate as a function of thermal time (TT) was used to determine the impact of planting date on growth of sweet corn. A base temperature (Tb) of 6.6\u00b0C for the three genotypes, obtained from experimental data, was used. Days to emergence varied from 4 to 12 for the warmest and coolest growing seasons, respectively. The growth of the three sweet corn genotypes showed a clear response to planting dates as LAI, canopy height, and aboveground biomass and the individual plant components, including stem, sheath, and leaves were significantly (P < 0.05) different at the beginning of tasseling. For all experiments, the longer the maturity group, the higher the total aboveground biomass. Significant differences (P < 0.05) for growth rate were found between planting dates, genotypes, plant components and their interactions. The short-season hybrid tended to have a faster overall plant growth rate of all individual plant components during the warmer seasons. In contrast, the mid- and full-season hybrids tended to have a higher growth rate during the cooler seasons. For rainfed conditions, the short-season hybrid had higher leaf and sheath growth rates than the mid- and full-season hybrids, resulting in a higher stem growth rate.

The potential yield of current crops (interception of 0.46 of annual incident PAR; RUE 2.7\u202fg\u202fMJ\u22121 dry matter above ground, intercepted PAR; harvest index 0.5) was 12\u201314\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 for annual solar radiation 3300\u20133800\u202fMJ\u202fm\u22122 which is typical across wheat-growing regions of the United Kingdom. Many combinations of increases in interception (especially retention of green leaves into August and September), RUE and harvest index would achieve potential yields of 20\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 in sunny locations or sunny years with annual solar radiation of 3800\u202fMJ\u202fm\u22122 or above.Advancing growth duration by one month reduced yields because there was little radiation to be intercepted in March and much to be missed in July and August. If duration was advanced one month and extended by one month of maximum interception then yields were increased by around 16%.From the relationships among yield, nitrogen concentrations of grain and straw, and nitrogen supply from soil and fertilizer, yields of 20\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 would require fertilizer application of 450\u2013680\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha\u22121 for breadmaking wheat (13% protein) and 350\u2013580\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha\u22121 for feed wheat (11% protein), with soil supply 100\u2013200\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha\u22121 and harvest index 0.5\u20130.6. If nitrogen application was restricted to the N-max limit for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (440\u2013500\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha\u22121) then 20\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 was achievable only with soil supply well above 100\u202fkg\u202fN\u202fha\u22121.Potential yield of wheat of 20\u202ft\u202fha\u22121 is possible in the United Kingdom from new cultivars with improved interception of radiation, RUE and harvest index (e.g. by 17%, 32% and 18%, respectively). Improved RUE can be exploited if optimum water and nutrients are maintained throughout crop duration. Increased harvest index raises yield and reduces straw and also produces a larger yield for a given amount of nitrogen supplied. High-yielding crops will require proportionate increases in nitrogen supply from the soil and fertilizer."}, "6799704": {"title": "Light interactions, use and efficiency in row crop canopies under optimal growth conditions", "abstract": "Accurate estimates of light (Photosynthetically Active Radiation or PAR) absorption, in addition to other interactions is imperative to quantify growth, productivity, energy and water balance and other physiological and biophysical processes in any vegetative surface. Currently, a comparative assessment of light interaction patterns across row crops is lacking, especially under current levels of productivity achieved in the U.S. High Plains. Here, we continuously measured canopy light balance components at high-frequency (15\u00a0min) to characterize transmittance (R), reflectance (R), fraction of intercepted PAR (fIPAR), fraction of absorbed PAR (fAPAR), light extinction coefficients (k), and light use efficiency (LUE) comparatively across maize, soybean, sorghum and winter wheat under optimal growth conditions. While maximum fAPAR was 88-96% of incoming PAR in all crops, mean fAPAR varied from 82% in sorghum to 46% in winter wheat; while k ranged from 0.36 (winter wheat) to 0.48 (sorghum and soybean), and these differences reflect highly crop-specific signatures. Conversion factors among fIPAR and fAPAR and LUE based on either component (LUE\u1d62 and LUE\u2090) were quantified that were substantially different from the conventionally used values; especially during early and late growth stages. A commonly employed approach of solar-noon light sampling was evaluated, and it was found that early and late stages of crop growth experience greater potential errors (as high as 110%) under this sampling approach, and hence should be avoided. LUE\u2090 was the highest for maize (5.3 g MJ\u207b\u00b9), followed by sorghum (4.1 g MJ\u207b\u00b9), winter wheat (4.0 g MJ\u207b\u00b9) and soybean (3.1 g MJ\u207b\u00b9).

A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of blocking furrow ends and cutting-off furrow inflow earlier to eliminate runoff and save water, rather than using the common practice of 4- to 6-h runoff to wet the beds on the lower ends of fields. Earlier cutoff is feasible with wheat because flow retardance by the plants in furrows increases transient flow volume, thus causing soil wetting to closely follow furrow advance. Both adequate (3 to 4 applications) and deficit (1 to 2 applications) irrigation regimes were evaluated during the study. With adequate irrigation, the elimination of runoff with blocked furrows and earlier cutoff reduced average gross irrigation applications from 430 to 335 mm (16.9 to 13.2 in.) or 22% without reducing grain yield.

To meet the associated increase in China's food demand with the expected growth in its already large population of 1.3 billion and diet changes, wheat production in the NCP needs to increase. Because of the farmland reduction due to urbanization, strategies for increasing wheat production in the NCP should be targeted at increasing current yields. To identify options for increasing wheat yields, we analyzed the yield potentials and yield gaps using the EPIC (Environment Policy Integrated Climate) model, Kriging interpolation techniques, GIS and average farm yields at county level. As most (ca. 82%) of the winter wheat in the NCP is irrigated, it is justified to use potential yield as the benchmark of the yield gap assessment. Wheat potential yields simulated with EPIC using daily weather data from 1960 to 2007 at 43 representative sites varied from 6.6 to 9.1tha\u22121 in the NCP, generally increasing from north to south associated with decreasing low temperature stress.

Cropping systems evaluated were: (i) annual double-cropping of wheat and soybean (MG IV); (ii) four 2-year rotations of wheat-soybean double-cropped followed by full-season soybean the next year, where the same soybean MG (I, III, IV, and V) was grown both years; and (iii) a 3-year rotation of wheat, wheat, and full-season (MG V) soybean. On average, wheat yields ranged from 51 bu/acre following early MG I soybean in the 2-year double-crop rotation to 36 bu/acre following MG IV soybean in the annual double-cropping system. Wheat yield differences were primarily determined by planting date. Full-season (MG V) soybean yields were highest (35 bu/acre) following two years of wheat in the 3-year rotation. Double-crop soybean yields in the annual double-cropping system averaged 26 bu/acre for MG IV.

The soil (a Walla Walla silt loam; coarse silty, mixed mesic Typic Haploxeroll) is considered highly deficient in N and marginally deficient in P and S for annual cereal production. Crop residue was finely chopped in 1984 and burned in 1985 to 1988, to compare with stubble left standing. Fertility treatments consisted of increasing rates of N, P, and S [none (0-0-0 kg N-P-S ha\u2212\u00b9), low (56-6-9), moderate (112-11-18), and high (168-17-27)], banded cm below the seed.

Standing stubble decreased grain yield of winter wheat 13% and straw yield 15%, compared with chopping or burning; it decreased spring wheat grain and straw yields <5%. Standing residue affected straw and grain yields similarly, but had little effect on grain protein. Fertilizer increased grain and straw yield every year, and more so in winter than in spring wheat.

Irrigated wheat is uncommon in sub-tropical Australia because cotton is more profitable, but high grain prices in 2008 triggered a record area of irrigated wheat production. Unfortunately, widespread lodging occurred and yields were lower than expected, although the losses directly attributable to lodging were unknown.Crop models have not been previously validated for calculating potential yield and yield gaps of mechanised, lodging-susceptible production systems. This study aimed to determine potential yield, farmer-realised yield, and water use requirements of lodging-prone irrigated wheat in sub-tropical Australia, using field monitoring and the APSIM simulation model. Yield data were obtained in 2008 and 2009 from 16 commercial irrigated wheat fields and multiple treatments from four irrigated experiments, and used to assess APSIM's ability to predict grain yield of irrigated wheat.APSIM predicted biomass production satisfactorily in 2008 but substantially over-predicted grain yield of lodged fields. The mean difference (yield gap) between APSIM-estimated potential yield and farmer-realised yield was 1.0tha\u22121 in non-lodged fields, and 2.7tha\u22121 in lodged fields. The average effect of lodging was therefore a decrease of 1.7tha\u22121; the difference between the yield gap calculated for lodged and non-lodged fields. Yield gaps in lodged fields were highly correlated with soil N content at sowing, with most of the lodged fields having more than 300kgha\u22121 of soil N at sowing to a depth of 90cm.In 2009, management of commercial fields aimed to avoid lodging by using the canopy management technique of in-season N application. APSIM generally under-predicted biomass production and yield in these fields, suggesting that the N uptake parameters in APSIM may require adjustment. Observed yields from fields of a quick-maturing cultivar that experienced little lodging were simulated accurately when N was assumed to be non-limiting.The simulation study found that the potential yield of irrigated spring wheat in sub-tropical Australia is currently between 8 and 9tha\u22121, and average growing season evapotranspiration of such crops was approximately 500\u2013550mm. Potential yield of furrow-irrigated fields with one or two-metre wide beds were 16% and 8% lower, due to the area occupied by the 60cm wide unsown furrows between irrigation beds.This study demonstrated the value of using validated simulation models for estimating potential yield and yield gap analysis. Yield gap analysis also enabled the identification of agronomic characteristics (high levels of soil residual N) which probably contributed to lodging. Further investigation is required to determine whether alternative varieties or the canopy management technique of in-season N application can increase the potential yield of irrigated spring wheat above the levels reported here."}, "6434890": {"title": "Sugarcane and Wheat Productivity Under Different Cropping Systems", "abstract": "Under wheat- and sugarcane-\u00a0based cropping system in North India, wheat is taken either as intercrop in autumn sugarcane or as a sole crop followed by sugarcane planting in summer months (April\u2013May).

Moreover, wheat yield is also less as an intercrop than its sole crop as only two rows of wheat are there in 90\u00a0cm spaced autumn sugarcane.

Experiments were carried out in shallow plastic boxes placed directly on the ground in the field for studies of the effects of seedbed properties on emergence of various crops. This paper presents an analysis of the time required for germination and emergence under near-optimal seedbed conditions. The crops studied were barley, oats, wheat, pea, rape seed, white mustard, sugar beet, red clover and timothy. The time required for germination generally increased with size of the seeds, presumably because larger seeds needed more water to initiate germination. This applied both when comparing different crops and different seed sizes of the same crop. However, considerable differences occurred between seed lots of the same crop and there were greater differences between seed lots of the same crop than between the three small grain crops studied. Growth rate of the seedlings generally increased with seed size, presumably because of increased energy content in the seed. Consequently, the most rapid emergence was obtained from small seeds at shallow sowing and from large seeds at deep sowing. The crops studied had a minimum temperature for germination and seedling growth close to 0 \u00b0C. Under optimal seedbed conditions, thermal time required for 50% germination of barley was typically about 65 \u00b0C days over this base temperature and for seedling growth about 6 \u00b0C days cm\u207b\u00b9.

Infrared warming with automatic control of temperature rise has shown potential for warming field plots above ambient temperatures, while avoiding such biases. In a field experiment conducted at Maricopa, AZ, we assessed the utility of a temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) approach by comparing phenology of wheat from a series of six sowing date treatments using T-FACE and an additional nine sowing dates that exposed crops to an exceptionally wide range of air temperatures (<0\u00c2\u00b0C to >40\u00c2\u00b0C).

Recruitment the following spring occurred very early in terms of accumulated growing\u2013\u2013degree days (base temperature of 0 C) but expressed as a proportion of total seeds broadcast was low and variable. Total cumulative emergence of wheat over all 4 site yr ranged from 0.9 to 13.1%%, with an overall average of 4.3%%. There was no relationship between preharvest sprouting-resistance characteristics and recruitment proportion, and no significant influence of tillage treatment on wheat recruitment. Wheat seed that did not recruit was rapidly degraded in the soil and did not persist for more than 12 mo. However, some emerged volunteer wheat plants escaped all control measures normally used in establishing and growing a typical flax crop, and these escaped volunteer wheat plants set viable seed. Therefore, results of this study indicate that efforts and attention should be directed toward achieving very high levels of volunteer wheat control in subsequent rotational crops and that reseeding by escaped volunteer wheat plants may be a more important persistence mechanism for spring wheat than multiyear soil seedbank persistence.Nomenclature: Flax, Linum usitatissimum L., \u2018\u2018CDC Bethune\u2019\u2019; spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L., \u2018\u2018AC Barrie\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018AC Domain\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018AC Intrepid\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018AC Majestic\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018CDC Teal\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Katepwa\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018McKenzie\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Superb\u2019\u2019."}, "1237223": {"title": "Effects of grazing on crop crown temperature: implications for phenology", "abstract": "In many regions, livestock are allowed to graze grain crops during their vegetative development, before grain is harvested at crop maturity. Little is known of the effects of grazing on crop microclimate, particularly the effects of defoliation on crown temperatures. Knowledge of such effects is important because temperature is the main factor underpinning crop ontogeny, and ontogeny drives dry matter allocation, leaf appearance rates and the timing of anthesis, which are key determinants of grain yield. The primary aim of this study was to examine the influence of grazing intensity and duration on the crown temperatures of winter wheat crops grown at Canberra, Australia. A secondary aim was to examine the association between crown temperature and phenology. In 2007, wheat cv. Mackellar was grazed at intensity\u2013duration combinations of low\u2013short (LS, 33 sheep/ha for 31 days), heavy\u2013short (HS, 67 sheep/ha for 31 days) or low\u2013long (LL, 33 sheep/ha for 62 days). In 2008, cvv. Mackellar and Naparoo were grazed at the HS intensity-duration. Cubic smoothing splines were fitted to crown temperature data measured between the end of grazing and anthesis to facilitate identification of long-term trends and statistical differences caused by the effects of defoliation on crown temperature. Grazing treatments with greater intensity or longer duration significantly elevated maximum daily crown temperature; differences of 6\u20137\u00b0C were common in the month following grazing. Cubic-spline analysis showed that long-term trends in maximum crown temperature of the HS and LL treatments were significantly greater than corresponding temperatures of controls for the entire post-grazing duration. By contrast, effects of grazing on minimum diurnal crown temperature were small. Increasing biomass removal significantly delayed stem elongation and anthesis. We demonstrate that although initial phenological delays caused by defoliation are large, greater diurnal crown temperature fluctuation in grazed crops leads to greater growing degree-day accumulation between the end of grazing and anthesis. This increases the rate of thermal time accumulation during the post-grazing\u2013anthesis period and is likely prominent in driving greater development rates of grazed crops. We further demonstrate that delays in phenology associated with grazing can be largely accounted for by a thermal time constant, with the LS, HS and LL treatments delaying stem elongation by ~52, 141 and 214 degree-days, respectively, above a base temperature of 0\u00b0C.

Various irrigation treatments were imposed during vegetative growth after canopy closure when solar radiation was almost fully intercepted. Shoot and root plus nodule biomass and N accumulation were determined from periodic harvests. Solar radiation use-efficiencies were computed from regressions of biomass against cumulative solar radiation, and were found to range from 0.53 g MJ\u207b\u00b9 under daily irrigation, to 0.23 g MJ\u207b\u00b9 under the most severe drought treatment. Nitrogen accumulation rates were computed by regression of N accumulation against time, and were found to decline from 0.31 g N m\u207b\u00b2 day\u207b\u00b9 for the daily irrigation to 0.003 g N m\u207b\u00b2 day\u207b\u00b9 for the most severe drought treatment. In both years and all three drought treatments, the N accumulation rate was decreased relatively more than the solar radiation use-efficiency for biomass accumulation.

In Experiment 1, aboveground biomass at R5 (TDWR5) of the temperate cultivars was one-third to one-fourth of that of the tropical cultivars. This was associated with less than half the amount of the cumulative intercepted radiation to R5 (CIRR5) due to their shorter growth duration and lower value of the mean fraction of canopy light interception till R5 (mean FVE-R5). In addition, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) at R5 of the temperate cultivars was also as low as 0.54gMJ\u22121, as compared to 0.87gMJ\u22121 in the tropical cultivars. The value of canopy temperature minus air temperature (CTd), as an indicator of relative transpiration activity, of temperate cultivars was markedly larger than that of the tropical cultivars, indicating lower transpiration activity in temperate cultivars, which was associated with the low RUE. In Experiment 2, greater activity of transpiration in tropical cultivars was attributed to their higher stomatal conductance (gs) and greater stomatal density (Nstoma) of upper leaves than that in those from the temperate regions. These results indicate that low biomass production in temperate cultivars occurs not only due to the cumulative intercepted radiation in the canopy but also due to low RUE and that the low RUE in temperate cultivars is associated with low gas exchange activity, in which leaf morphological traits are involved.

Varieties in Maturity Groups (MG) III to VII were planted in mid-April and in mid-May near Blossom and Hooks, TX, from 1986 to 1988. There were significant year and location effects on yield. Two MG III varieties planted in April 1986 at Blossom yielded eight times more than the MG V to VII varieties. Negative correlations were found between yield and maturity date in 1986 and 1987. Early drought stress in 1988 reduced yields about 30% for the April-planted MG III and IV varieties, but yield was again negatively correlated with maturity date. Yields at the Hooks site were up to 45.8 bu/acre higher than those at Blossom, but they were also negatively correlated with maturity date in the April 1986 planting. The seasonal rainfall at Hooks in 1987 was less than half that of 1986 resulting in varietal yields from the early planting being reduced from 8.3 up to 47.1 bu/acre.

Research QuestionLate summer drought stress often limits yield of soybean grown in the southern USA. A field study was conducted to determine if earlier planting of early-maturing varieties could avoid periods of drought stress by having reproductive development coincide with times of greater moisture availability. Literature SummaryIn northeast Texas, as in most of the southern USA, the optimum planting time for MG V to VII varieties is considered to be from mid-May to early-June. Under such production systems, flowering, pod-set, and seed filling occur from late July to early September. This period of reproductive development often coincides with prolonged periods of low rainfall and high temperature. It would be advantageous to shift this period of high water requirement to a time of greater moisture availability, as commonly occurs in June and early-July. Planting MG V to VII varieties earlier (mid-April) does not achieve this goal because plants still mature within 7 to 10 d of plants seeded at optimum dates. Moreover, the short-days of April may induce premature flowering that results in reduced plant height and limited yield potential for traditional determinate plant types. While MG V to VII varieties are primarily determinate, MG III and IV varieties are generally indeterminate. Indeterminate types continue to grow vegetatively after flowering begins; thus, plant heights are reduced less than those of determinate types planted in mid-April. Also, MG III to IV varieties planted in the southern USA mature earlier than MG V to VII varieties. Study DescriptionThis research (Table 1) was conducted for 3 yr at two nonirrigated locations in northeast Texas. The Blossom site has a clay soil and the Hooks site has a silt loam. Varieties: MG III \u2014 Williams 82, Asgrow A3966; MG IV \u2014 FFR 441, Crawford, Egyptian, Northrup King RA 451; MG V \u2014 Asgrow A5474, Forrest; MG VI \u2014 Centennial, Leflore; MG VII \u2014 Bragg, Jacob Hartz H7126; Applied QuestionsWill the planting of early-maturing (MG III and IV) soybean varieties in mid-April reduce risks associated with late-summer drought in the southern USA? The heavy clay soil at the Blossom site is considered low in available moisture and cracks deeply when dry. Furthermore, high temperatures and generally low rainfall in late-July and August result in drought stress most years. The highest yielding varieties in this test in 1986 and 1987, averaging more than 40 bu/acre, were the MG III varieties Williams 82 and A3966 planted in mid-April. The average yield of the six April-planted MG III and IV varieties was 32.3 and 34.2 bu/acre in 1986 and 1987, respectively (Table 2). The average yield of the six May-planted MG V to VII varieties was only 9.4 and 7.6 bu/acre in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Thus, in the first 2 yr, early planting of early-maturing soybean varieties suxessfully avoided late-summer drought and resulted in seed yields substantially higher than those obtained with conventional production practices. The Blossom site received much less rainfall in May and June of 1988 than in 1986 and 1987. Therefore, the average yield of the April-planted MG III and IV varieties was reduced about 5 bu/acre to 28.9 bu/acre and the May-planted test was lost due to poor plant stands resulting from the dry conditions. The silt loam soil at Hooks holds more available moisture than the clay soil at Blossom. Soybean grown at Hooks showed less drought stress and had higher yields than soybean grown at Blossom. Still, average yield of the six April-planted MG III and IV varieties was more than the average yield of the six May-planted MG V to VII varieties (Table 2). In 1986, rainfall was plentiful during the growing season. The early-planted MG III and IV varieties averaged 43.9 bu/acre while the May-planted MG V to VII varieties averaged 34.7 bu/acre. Half as much rain fell in the 1987 growing season as in the 1986 growing season. The average yield of the six April-planted MG III and IV varieties was 24.5 bu/acre in 1987, while the May-planted MG V to VII varieties averaged only 15.3 bu/acre. The first half of the growing season in 1988 was dry at Hooks. The May planting was lost due to the dry conditions, while the average yield of the six April-planted MG III and IV varieties was 35.4 bu/acre. Even on a silt loam soil, early planting of early-maturing soybean varieties was superior to the conventional system in all 3 yr of the study. Will yields of MG V to VII varieties be increased by planting in mid-April rather than mid-May? Planting the MG V to VII varieties early did not result in higher yields. Average yield from the six April-planted MG V to VII varieties was similar to average yield from the May-planting at both Blossom (5.2 vs. 9.4 bu/acre in 1986 and 11.8 vs. 7.6 bu/acre in 1987) and Hooks (40.9 vs. 34.7 bu/acre in 1986 and 11.3 vs. 15.3 bu/acre in 1987). Will yields be unfavorable if planting of the MG III and IV varieties is delayed from mid-April until mid-May? At Blossom, the average yield of the six MG III and IV varieties was reduced from 32.3 to 15.7 bu/acre in 1986 and from 34.2 to 15.0 bu/acre in 1987, when planting was delayed from mid-April to mid-May (Table 2). At Hooks, the average yield of the same varieties was reduced from 43.9 to 34.3 bu/acre in 1986 and from 24.5 to 15.3 bu/acre in 1987 (Table 2). However, average yield of the six May-planted MG III and IV varieties at both locations and in both years was equal to or greater than average yield of the six MG V to VII varieties also planted in May.

This difference was significant (P = .05) and was due mainly to lack of nutsedge (Cyperus sp.) control by herbicide alone in no-tillage plots. In the third year when the crop was hand-hoed, no yield differences occurred due to tillage methods. The 2-year average yield of grain sorghum was 3,249 kg/ha (48.3 bu/acre) for no-tillage and 3,868 kg/ha (57.5 bu/acre) for conventional tillage. When the crop was handhoed yield of grain sorghum was significantly higher for no-tillage (5,072 vs 4.335 kg/ha). Wheat grown after soybeans yielded significantly (P = .05) more than wheat grown after grain sorghum.

From 15 manual defoliation experiments over 3 yr, significant linear decreases in yield occurred in both full-season and double-crop soybean when leaf area index values were below 3.5-4.0 by developmental stages R4 to R5, whereas yields usually reached a plateau at higher leaf area index levels.

Increase in PPD up to 38 plants m\u207b\u00b2 increased main stem length and decreased all other plant components. Decrease in main stem yield was proportionately smaller than the increase in PPD resulting in a net yield gain from higher PPD. Decrease in branch stem yield was proportionately greater than the increase in PPD resulting in a net yield loss from PPD increase. For determinate soybean planted at a 0.5 m RS an increase in PPD above that needed at optimal dates was necessary to obtain highest yields at post-optimal planting dates. Soybean planted at the 1.0 m RS had much lower yield and was much less responsive to increase in PPD. Contribution from the La. State Univ. Agric. Center, La. Agric. Exp. Stn.

Harvest maturity had the greatest effect on soybean forage yield and quality of the management practices evaluated. The yield of soybean forage increased from 2.4 Mg ha\u207b\u00b9 when harvested at R1 to 7.4 Mg ha\u207b\u00b9 when harvested at R7, but quality declined between stages R1 and R5 then increased from R5 to R7 as pods developed and seeds filled. Late maturing cultivars (Maturity Group III vs. Maturity Group II) produced greater forage yields but lower quality forage when harvested at the same stage of development. The 20-cm row spacing produced 1.2 Mg ha\u207b\u00b9 more forage than the 76-cm row spacing, but crude protein concentration was 8 g kg\u207b\u00b9 less.

Planting of soybean was performed manually each year in the beginning of May using the 50 cm row spacing (wide rows) and 25 cm spacing (narrow rows), the distance between seeds in a row was 15 cm. In each case of row spacing, the soybean cultivar and the year of the experiment influenced the mean yield of the soybean. For the dense sowing, the significantly higher yield of soybean (3428 kg/ha) was detected compared to the thin sowing (2690 kg/ha). The significant influence of the cultivar was found in every year in case of the thin sowing, where the yield in the 2001 (the year of the drought) was significantly lower compared to other years. For the thin sowing, the most productive cultivar was the Borostyan (3974 kg/ha), the lowest mean yield was recorded for the cultivar Aldana (1472 kg/ha). For the dense sowing, significantly higher soybean yield was confirmed in 2005 (3760 kg/ha), compared to the years 2002 (3145 kg/ha) and 2003 (3239 kg/ha), when the yields were significantly lower. The cultivar Aldana recorded the lowest yield (2110 kg/ha) also in the case of dense sowing, while under the same growing conditions, the cultivar Tisa (5171 kg/ha) proved to be the most productive cultivar.

This study aimed to gain a better understanding of how competition for light affects leaf and tiller development, radiation capture and conversion to biomass, and its partitioning between leaves and stalks. A first ratoon crop of cultivar NCo376 was started on 29 August 2003 (when the plant crop was cut back) at Mount Edgecombe, South Africa (29\u00b042'18.4\"S, 31\u00b002'48.5\"E, 105m). A wagon wheel design was used with RS ranging from 0.36m to 2.66m and the crop received adequate water and nutrients. Radiation interception was measured within cane rows (FIINTRA) and across cane rows (FIINTER). FIINTRA was not affected by RS and maximum FIINTRA (defined as the first value above 0.9) was reached simultaneously for all RS. The progression of FIINTER differed substantially between the different RS. Maximum green leaf number was attained when FIINTRA reached 90% and coincided with the occurrence of peak tiller density. Thereafter there was a gradual decline in green leaf number caused by intra-row competition for light. As soon as FIINTER exceeded a value of 90%, there was a drastic reduction in green leaf number due to a sharp acceleration in leaf senescence rate induced by inter-row competition for light. Inter-row competition had an effect on aboveground biomass accumulation of RS of less than 1.37m from before the first sampling at 730\u00b0Cd (base temperature of 16\u00b0C). For RS of 1.73m the competition effect commenced sometime between the first and second sampling (at 948\u00b0Cd). There appeared to be no inter-row competition effect for RS of 2.15m and more. Radiation use efficiency seemed unaffected by RS (average value of 1.50gMJ\u207b\u00b9), although the increase in biomass yield (22% per metre reduction in RS) could not be fully explained by a concurrent increase in intercepted radiation (source size--18% per metre reduction in RS). Sink size (stalk density) responded more to a decrease in RS than source size (intercepted radiation) and the latter became insufficient to fill the sink to capacity when row spacing was less than 1.37m. Conversely, sink size appeared to be the limiting factor for wider RS as evidenced by a similar mass per stalk for different RS. The stalk partition fraction of biomass increments was unaffected by row spacing, although the start of stalk growth was delayed with decreasing RS in terms of the threshold biomass required for stalk partitioning to commence. This resulted in lower final stalk fractions for narrower RS. The information obtained in this study enabled important new insights into underlying mechanisms of row spacing-induced competition effects on sugarcane growth and development. It should be useful for improving crop models' ability to predict crop response to row spacing more accurately and in a more functional manner. The improved understanding could highlight avenues for effective crop improvement (e.g. ideal canopy development sub-traits) and crop management (e.g. weed and water management)."}, "5326420": {"title": "Coupling a sugarcane crop model with the remotely sensed time series of fIPAR to optimise the yield estimation", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of the assimilation of the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) data derived from Satellite Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre SPOT images into the MOSICAS sugarcane crop growth model for estimating the yield at field scale on Reunion Island.

The agronomic performance of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sown into CT seedbeds with double-disk drills or into standing stubble with several types of no-till (NT) drills (hoe, single disk, and notched coulter), was determined in two experiments conducted both in 1996 and 1997 where the previous crop was either winter wheat or spring barley. We measured stand establishment, seed-zone temperature, soil water, dry biomass accumulation, rhizoctonia root rot, surface residue retention, and grain yield components. Plant stand (r2 = 0.60), dry biomass accumulation (r2 = 0.63), and spike density (r2 = 0.62) as single independent variables, and combined in a multiple regression model (R2 = 0.81), were strongly correlated (P < 0.001) to grain yield. Early-season seed-zone temperatures were cooler under NT, but seed-zone water was slightly higher with CT. Low spike density consistently occurred in a wide row spacing (406 mm) NT drill treatment, and the highest overall yields were obtained with NT drills with rows spaced 255 mm or less. Rhizoctonia root rot was severe on seminal roots in all treatments in three out of four trials, but did not appear to limit yields, possibly due to healthy crown roots and favorable growing conditions. No-till spring sowing into undisturbed standing stubble (2420\u20135230 kg ha\u207b\u00b9) can produce grain yields equal to or exceeding those under CT and can provide environmental and potential soil quality benefits for low-precipitation dryland farming areas in the inland Pacific Northwest."}, "1309190": {"title": "Barley seeding rate influences the effects of variable herbicide rates on wild oat", "abstract": "Field experiments were conducted at Vegreville, Alberta, in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and in Lacombe, Alberta, in 1997 and 1998, to determine if barley row spacing (20 and 30 cm) and seeding rate (75, 125, and 175 kg ha\u207b\u207b\u00b9) influenced the effects of variable tralkoxydim rates on barley seed yield, net economic returns, and wild oat seed production.

In addition, these studies evaluated the influence of row spacing and seeding rate on tillering. The genotypes differed significantly in shoot and spike number. Shoot number for the highest tillering genotype was 42 to 71% greater than for the lowest, depending on the study, but the genotypes ranked consistently over years and locations.

The optimized regulated deficit irrigation (ORDI) methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water-scarce conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ORDI for a limited amount of available irrigation water on yield, water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop (Shakira cv.) under semiarid conditions. To this end, five irrigation treatments were performed over three years (2015\u20132017) on an experimental farm located in Albacete province: no deficit (ND) (control), and four with different volumes of available irrigation water, corresponding to 100 % (T100), 90 % (T90), 80 % (T80), and 70 % (T70) of barley net irrigation requirements (2500\u202fm\u00b3\u202fha\u207b\u00b9) for the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year. As expected, yield decreased with deficit and ND was the treatment that achieved the highest average yield (9049\u202fkg ha\u207b\u00b9).

Yields above average were achieved only in years when grain filling duration exceeded 42 d. Protein concentrations below 10.5 % and grading percentages over 90 % required at least 44 d of grain filling. Temperature had the strongest influence on the length of grain filling, even though the calculated Growing Degree Days (base temperature 3 \u00b0C) were not absolutely constant. Mean daily temperature and relative air humidity were the best estimators with respect to grain yield. An optimum temperature range was found between 14 and 18 \u00b0C. Assuming a linear relationship, yield reductions between 4.1 and 5.7 % have been calculated for every 1 \u00b0C increase of the mean daily temperature.

Although a precise base temperature is essential for the accuracy of thermal time models, estimations of this parameter for barley grain filling are scarce in the literature; moreover, the methods employed for its determination seldom establish clearly whether grain filling is being treated as a development or as a growth phenomenon. Even worse, the base temperature during grain filling is usually arbitrarily set to zero. In this work we tested five different methods to estimate the thermal time requirement for completing grain filling in four commercial barley cultivars and the base temperature above which temperature must be accumulated for its calculation, using field-collected data. The crops were sown in a wide range of different dates during three consecutive years and grown under two contrasting nitrogen availabilities. All the estimation methods performed relatively well. Developmental base temperature was close to 8 \u00b0C for all cultivars, although genotypic differences were noted. Optimum temperatures for grain filling are reported for three of the four cultivars; however, including this parameter in the models only slightly improved the predictions in one out of three cultivars. The effect of nitrogen availability was negligible and inconsistent across cultivars and environments thus indicating that the models developed can be applied in a wide range of nutritional situations. A broad application model, with a base temperature of 8.4 \u00b0C and a thermal time requirement for completing grain filling of 352 \u00b0Cd, is reported for barley grain development.

There was a close correlation between grain yield and aboveground biomass at maturity, while there was little variation in the harvest index among environments. Large biomass accumulation was mainly caused by intense incident radiation at Yunnan, as there was little difference in crop radiation use efficiency (RUE) between locations. Large leaf area index (LAI) was also suggested to be an important factor. Average nitrogen (N) accumulation over 2 years was 49% higher at Yunnan than at Kyoto, and also contributed to the large biomass accumulation at Yunnan. The treatments of varied N application for Takanari revealed that the ratio of N accumulated at maturity to the amount of fertilized N was significantly higher at Yunnan than at Kyoto, even though there was no great difference in soil fertility. The Takanari plot with high N application showed a N saturation in plant growth at Kyoto, which might be related to low radiation and relatively high temperatures during the mid-growth stage.

Three-year field experiments evaluated the effects of breeding on grain yield and its physiological determinants, including RUE, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), aboveground biomass production, and harvest index (HI), in three representative super hybrid rice varieties released between 1999 and 2015 and grown under three N regimes (N0: 0\u202fkg\u202fha\u2013\u00b9, N1: 210\u202fkg\u202fha\u207b\u00b9, N2: 300\u202fkg\u202fha\u2013\u00b9). Grain yield in the recently developed super hybrid rice cultivar Y-liangyou 900 (YLY900) increased significantly, relative to Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ) and Y-liangyou 2 (YLY2), reaching more than 11\u202ft\u202fha\u2013\u00b9 in the N2 treatment each year. Yield improvements in YLY900 were primarily due to increased aboveground biomass production resulting from a higher RUE, being 10.6 % (biomass) and 12.1 % (RUE) higher than those in LYPJ and YLY2. Unlike YLY900, aboveground biomass accumulation in LYPJ and YLY2 mostly resulted from increased IPAR. Nitrogen supply significantly increased intercepted radiation and intercepted percentage but not RUE. The N treatments had no effect on HI, within or between varieties. Grain yield had a significant (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) positive correlation with both intercepted radiation and RUE in all three cultivars. The multiple regression analysis showed that the higher grain yield in YLY900 was more closely related to RUE, while those in LYPJ and YLY2 were highly dependent on intercepted radiation. Considering that YLY900 had a significant yield advantage, we conclude that RUE plays a more prominent role than HI in yield progress in super hybrid rice.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the productivity of erect panicle rice Shennong265 in Western Japan under varied conditions. Three rice cultivars, Shennong265, Nipponbare, and Takanari were grown in the field under different fertilizer and plant density conditions in Western Japan; using this information, we compared yield and growth characteristics of Shennong265 with those of Nipponbare and Takanari. Although Shennong265 had radiation use efficiency similar to that of the high yielding cultivar (Takanari) and much higher leaf nitrogen content than Takanari and Nipponbare, the average grain yield of Shennong265 grown under normal fertilizer and plant density conditions was approximately 6.9 t ha\u207b\u00b9 as against 6.2 t ha\u207b\u00b9 for Nipponbare and 9.6 t ha\u207b\u00b9 for Takanari. These results suggest that, while Shennong265 has a high yield potential, the environmental conditions including climate, fertilizer, and planting period provided in this study were not suitable for achieving its maximum yield. The reduced performance of Shennong265 may be caused by insufficient fertilizer after heading and by shorter growth periods, as well as by the climate of Western Japan.

The results showed that the yield-scaled GWP of Chinese major rice cropping systems during rice growing season was in the order: double rice cropping system (1188.9kg CO2equiv.Mg\u22121)>rice-upland crop rotation system (777.0kg CO2equiv.Mg\u22121)>single rice cropping system (346.7kg CO2equiv.Mg\u22121).

Intermittent irrigation significantly reduced yield-scaled GWP by 59% largely because of a significant reduction in CH4 emission and a significant increment in rice yield. No-tillage showed lower CH4 emission with similar rice yield in comparison with the conventional tillage, resulting in a reduction in yield-scaled GWP by 20%.

Plant height, tillering (associated with panicle number), root growth, leaf area, and morphology are the main features of vegetative growth stage. In the reproductive growth stage panicle development takes place. Booting and flowering are part of the reproductive growth stage.

Seven traits were analyzed, including recovery of brown rice (BR), milled rice (MR) and head rice (HR); grain yield (GY); and the yield of brown rice (BRY), milled rice (MRY) and head rice (HRY). A total of 77 QTLs distributed on 35 regions was detected in the three RIL populations. Four regions, where qBR5, qBR7, qBR10, and qBR12 were located, were validated in the RH-derived F\u2084:\u2085 population. In the three RIL populations, all the 11 QTLs for GY detected were accompanied with QTLs for two or all the three milling yield traits. Not only the allele direction for milling yield traits was unchanged, but also the effects were consistent with GY. In the RH-derived F\u2084:\u2085 population, regions controlling GY also affected all three milling yield traits. Results indicated that variations of BRY and MRY were mainly ascribed to GY, but HRY was determined by both GY and HR.

The results showed that the effects of rice panicles on canopy reflectance were concentrated in the visible region and the near-infrared region. The red band (670 nm) was the most affected by panicles, while the red-edge bands (720&ndash;740 nm) were less affected. In addition, a combination of near-infrared and red-edge bands was for the one that best predicted LAI, and the difference vegetation index (DI) (976, 733) performed the best, although it had relatively low estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 1.41 m2/m2).

Verification data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) showed that the PRDVI could minimize the panicle and background influence and was more sensitive to LAI (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 1.01 m2/m2) than other VIs during the post-heading stage.

This paper discusses the rice phase of the cropping system. Low grain yields of dry-seeded rice (Oryza sativa) grown on Flat land on Vertisols in the rainfed region of southern Lombok, Eastern Indonesia, are probably mainly due to (a) erratic rainfall (870-1220mm/yr), with water often limiting at sensitive growth stages, (b) consistently high temperatures (average maximum=31\u00b0C), and (c) low solar radiation. Farmers are therefore poor, and labour is hard and costly, as all operations are manual. Two replicated field experiments were run at Wakan (annual rainfall=868mm) and Kawo (1215mm) for 3 years (2001/2002 to 2003/2004) on Vertisols in southern Lombok. Dry-seeded rice was grown in 4 treatments with or without manual tillage on (a) PRBs, 1.2m wide, 200mm high, separated by furrows 300mm wide, 200mm deep, with no rice sown in the well-graded furrows, and (b) well-graded Flat land. Excess surface water was harvested from each treatment and used for irrigation after the vegetative stage of the rice. All operations were manual. There were no differences between treatments in grain yield of rice (mean grain yield=681g/m\u00b2) which could be partly explained by total number of tillers/hill and mean panicle length, but not number of productive tillers/hill, plant height or weight of 1000 grains. When the data from both treatments on PRBs and from both treatments on Flat land, each year at each site were analysed, there were also no differences in grain yield of rice (g/m\u00b2). When rainfall in the wet season up to harvest was over 1000mm (Year 2; Wakan, Kawo), or plants were water-stressed during crop establishment (Year 1; Wakan) or during grain-fill (Year 3: Kawo), there were significant differences in grain yield (g/1.5m\u00b2) between treatments; generally the grain yield (g/1.5m\u00b2) on PRBs with or without tillage was less than that on Flat land with or without tillage. However, when the data from both treatments on PRBs and from both treatments on Flat land, each year at each site, were analysed, the greater grain yield of dry-seeded rice on Flat land (mean yield 1 092g/1.5m\u00b2) than that on PRBs (mean 815g/1.5m\u00b2) was mainly because there were 25% more plants on Flat land. Overall when the data in the 2 outer rows and the 2 inner rows on PRBs were each combined, there was a higher number of productive tillers in the combined outer rows (mean 20.7tillers/hill) compared with that in the combined inner rows on each PRB (mean 18.2tillers/hill). However, there were no differences in grain yield between combined rows (mean 142g/m row). Hence with a gap of 500mm (the distance between the outer rows of plants on adjacent raised beds), plants did not compensate in grain yield for missing plants in furrows. This suggests that rice (a) also sown in furrows, or (b) sown in 7 rows with narrower row-spacing, or (c) sown in 6 rows with slightly wider row-spacing, and narrower gap between outer rows on adjacent beds, may further increase grain yield (g/1.5m\u00b2) in this system of PRBs. The growth and the grain yield (y in g/m\u00b2) of rainfed rice (with rainfall on-site the only source of water for irrigation) depended mainly on the rainfall (x in mm) in the wet season up to harvest (due either to site or year) with y =1.1x -308; r \u00b2 =0.54; p <0.005. However, 280mm (i.e. 32%) of the rainfall was not directly used to produce grain (i.e. when y =0g/m\u00b2).

Compared with those under the TF, root oxidation activity, photosynthetic rate, and activities of key enzymes in sucrose-to-starch conversion in grains during the grain filling period were significantly increased under the SM, whereas they were significantly reduced under the PM and NM treatments. Grain yield showed some reduction under all the non-flooded cultivations but differed largely among the treatments. The reduction in yield was 7.3-17.5% under the PM, 2.8-6.3% under the SM, and 39-49% under the NM. The difference in grain yield was not significant between TF and SM treatments. WUE for irrigation was increased by 314-367% under the PM, 307-321% under the SM, and 98-138% under the NM. Under the same treatment especially under non-flooded conditions, the indica hybrid cultivar showed a higher grain yield and higher WUE than the japonica cultivar. The SM significantly improved milling, appearance, and cooking qualities, whereas the PM or the NM decreased these qualities. We conclude that both PM and SM could significantly increase WUE, while the SM could also maintain a high grain yield and improve quality of rice.

The effects of different N application rates (0, 80, 160 and 240 kg ha-1) and of N rates interacting with the cultivation system were also evaluated. Resulting grain yields with SRI ranged from 5.6 to 7.3 t ha-1, and from 4.1 to 6.4 t ha-1 under TF management. On average, grain yields under SRI were 21% higher in 2005 and 22% higher in 2006 than with TF. Compared with TF, SRI plots had higher harvest index across four fertilizer N rates in both years. However, there was no significance difference in above-ground biomass between two cultivation systems in either year. ANUE was increased significantly under SRI at 80 kg N ha-1 compared with TF, while at higher N application rates, ANUE with SRI was significantly lower than TF. Compared with TF, PFP under SRI was higher across all four N rates in both years, although the difference at 240 kg N ha-1 was not significant. As N rate increased, the ANUE and PFP under both SRI and TF significantly decreased. Reduction in irrigation water use with SRI was 40% in 2005 and 47% in 2006, and water use efficiency, both total and from irrigation, were significantly increased compared to TF. With both SRI and TF, the highest N application was associated with decreases in grain yield, N use efficiency and water use efficiency. This is an important finding given current debates whether N application rates in China are above the optimum, especially considering consequences for soil and water resources. Cultivation system, N rates and their interactions all produced significant differences in this study.

An issue with the application of AWD is the prevalence of acid sulphate soils in the Mekong Delta. Three types of irrigation management were tested; continuously flooded (CF) where the water in the paddy was maintained at 5 cm; AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 15 cm below the ground surface, at which point the field was irrigated until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated \u221215 cm); AWD where the water level was allowed to fall to 30 cm below the ground surface before irrigation until the water level was at 1 cm above the ground surface (designated \u221230 cm). Two further experiments were also undertaken which examined the planting method (transplant v. direct sowing) and phosphorus rate on rice yield. There was no effect on yield caused by P fertilizer rate and irrigation management in any year, and there was no significant effect on soil pH or salinity caused by irrigation management. Overall net profitability was greatest for the AWD treatments because of the reduction in pumping and labour costs in the dry season. Transplanted rice improved yields, but the labour cost reduced overall profitability. The study shows that AWD (\u221215 cm) can be safely applied in acid sulphate soil areas within the triple rice areas of An Giang Mekong Delta and saved at least 0\u00b727 of total irrigated water quantity used during three of the six cropping seasons.

Understanding the role of humans in ensuring water and nutrient use efficiency is therefore an important ingredient of sustainable development. Crop production functions are often defined either as functions of water and nutrient deficiency or are based on economic production theory that conceptualizes production as a result of economic activities that take in inputs such as water, capital and labor and produce crop biomass as output. This paper fills a gap by consistently treating water and nutrient use and human agency in crop production, thus providing a better understanding of the role humans play in crop production. Uptake of water and nutrients are two dominant biophysical processes of crop growth while human agency, including irrigation machine power, land-preparing machine power and human labor force, determine limits of water and nutrient resources that are accessible to crops. Two crops, i.e., winter wheat and rice, which account for the majority of food crop production are considered in a rapidly developing region of the world, Jiangsu Province, China, that is witnessing the phenomenon of rural to urban migration. Its production is modeled in two steps. First water and nutrient efficiencies, defined as the ratios of observed uptake to quantities applied, are modeled as functions of labor and machine power (representing human agency). In the second step, crop yields are modeled as functions of water and nutrient efficiencies multiplied by amounts of water and fertilizers applied. As a result, crop production is predicted by first simulating water and nutrient uptake efficiencies and then determining yield as a function of water and nutrients that are actually taken up by crops. Results show that modeled relationship between water use efficiency and human agency explains 68% of observed variance for wheat and 49% for rice. The modeled relationship between nutrient use efficiency and human agency explains 49% of the variance for wheat and 56% for rice. The modeled relationships between yields and actual uptakes in the second step explain even higher percentages of observed the variance: 73% for wheat and 84% for rice.

The spatial distribution pattern of WRP is consistent with precipitation. The water use efficiency (WRE and WRP) of the three specific crops in this framework increased over time. The WRE of maize was significantly higher than that of rice and wheat, while the WRP of wheat was the lowest. WRU measures the total water resource appropriation during crop growth in both quantity and quality; WRP was able to show where water use efficiency needs to be improved; and the function of WRE to indicate water saving potential could not be replaced by notable indices, such as irrigation efficiency or generalized efficiency.

Therefore, the total irrigation cost of hybrid rice is higher, while the coarse rice has higher water productivity. Furthermore, the economic productivity of water applied to basmati\u00a0rice and coarse rice is higher than that of hybrid rice. Consumer preferences based on data from 150 consumers indicate that basmati rice is a favorite of consumers and that hybrid rice is the least popular.

We evaluated differences in biomass production and yield formation under three transplanting times for high-yielding cultivars having different heading characteristics. Early transplanting extended growth duration, but did not increase biomass production before heading, resulting in no improvement in total spikelet number and yield potential. For all the cultivars, cumulative air temperature better explained differences in biomass production under different transplanting times than did cumulative solar radiation. The results indicate that early-transplanted plants could not effectively utilize solar radiation for CO2 assimilation and that early biomass production in early-transplanted plants was constrained by low temperature. On the other hand, biomass production after heading and grain filling in late-heading cultivars were reduced with late transplanting time, owing to lower solar radiation and lower temperature. These results suggest that avoiding late transplanting can increase final biomass as well as acquire stable and high grain yield in late-heading cultivars in temperate regions, even if early biomass production after transplanting is reduced by low temperature. Two indica-dominant cultivars showed the highest grain yield and biomass productivity in the present study, but showed higher base temperature for biomass production, indicating that inidica-dominant cultivars were susceptible to low temperature.

An old (Pride 5) and a new (Pioneer 3902) maize hybrid were grown during 1989 and 1990 at the Elora Research Station, Ontario, on a London loam (Aquic Hapludalf) soil that had been tile drained. Both hybrids were grown at their respective optimum plant density for grain yield (i.e., 7 plants/m\u00b2 for Pride 5 and 8 plants/m\u00b2 for Pioneer 3902) and, in addition, the new hybrid was grown at 5 plants/m2 which resulted in a leaf area index (LAI) similar to that of the old hybrid grown at its optimum plant density. Starting at silking, 2-wk crop growth rates (CGR, kg ha\u207b\u00b9 d\u207b\u00b9) were measured until physiological maturity, and incident PAR and absorptance of PAR by the three treatments were monitored during three 2-wk periods after silking. From silking to 6 wk postsilking, PAR absorption did not differ among the two hybrids grown at plant densities that resulted in similar LAIs, but crop growth rate was 19% larger for the new hybrid. The difference in crop growth rate between the old and the new hybrid grown at their respective optimum plant density was 33%; approximately 80% of the difference could be attributed to a higher RUE of the new hybrid. The difference in RUE was not associated with a change in the distribution of PAR across the canopy, i.e., extinction coefficients did not differ among treatments. Dry matter accumulation declined for all treatments after 8 wk postsilking, but the decline was steeper for the old hybrid and the decline was associated with rate of leaf senescence. In conclusion, increased dry matter accumulation of new maize hybrids after silking can be attributed, in a large part, to increased radiation use efficiency.

Direct measurements of absorbed PAR from planting to physiological maturity of corn were consistently greater than the indirect estimates based on green LAI or the spectral vegetation indices. Consequently, the RUE calculated using directly measured absorbed PAR was lower than the RUE calculated using the indirect measures of absorbed PAR.

Radiation absorption, radiation use efficiency, biological yield, land equivalent ratio, crowding coefficient and system productivity index were greater in 2009 than in 2010. Radiation use efficiency for maize and bean were higher in 2009 than 2010 (8.9% and 17.6% respectively). The strip intercropping system enhanced radiation absorption, radiation use efficiency, biological yield, land equivalent ratio, crowding coefficient and system productivity index compared with the monoculture system. Increasing strip width from 2 to 5 rows resulted in a decrease all the criteria measured. The best strip width was with II and III strip intercropping treatments. Although biological yield in intercropping was less than in monoculture, total land productivity was improved by greater land equivalent ratio (1.39 and 1.37). This means that 39% and 37% more land was required for monoculture than intercropping to produce the same yields in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Therefore it was demonstrated that an intercropping system is more effective than a monoculture system in resource utilization.

Leaf nitrogen per unit area was also measured at these five stages plus two additional stages before and after the five core measurements. Total nitrogen and plant mass was accumulated at the seven stages to track total nitrogen accumulation and to calculate RUE. The overall patterns in the measured variables were similar to those reported for field maize. However, leaf nitrogen per unit area for sweet corn under optimum conditions was greater than reported for field maize.

However, tolerance of maize to broadcast flaming must be determined first to optimize the use of propane. Field experiments were conducted at the Haskell Agricultural Laboratory of the University of Nebraska, Concord, NE in 2008 and 2009 to determine maize response to five propane doses applied at three growth stages of V2 (2-leaf), V5 (5-leaf) and V7 (7-leaf).

The response of different growth stages of maize to propane doses was described by log\u00e2\u0080\u0093logistic models. Overall, maize response to broadcast flaming varied among growth stages and propane doses. In general, maize at V5 was the most tolerant stage for broadcast flaming, whereas V2 stage was the most susceptible to flaming resulting in the highest visual crop injury ratings, dry matter reductions and the largest loss of yield and its components. At 28 DAT, the maximum visual crop injury rating of 7% was estimated for flaming done at V5 stage compared to significantly higher injuries of 43% and 12% for V2 and V7 growth stages, respectively.

Based on these results, flaming has a potential to be used effectively in organic maize production when conducted properly at V5 stage.

These differences in level of BPC were 10% lower and 12% higher, for wheat and maize, respectively. We presume that low or absence effects of tile drainage because of their inadequate servicing could be expalantion for wheat yield decreasing. The lower yields of wheat are mainly in connection with oversupplies of water. However, low maize yields are in connection with water shortage and the higher air-temperatures.

Then, the temporal and spatial patterns of maize yield potentials and yield gaps during 1980\u20132008 were presented and analyzed. The results showed that maize yields became stagnated at 32.4% of maize-growing areas during the period. In the major maize production regions, i.e., northeastern China, the North China Plain (NCP) and southwestern China, yield gap percentages were generally less than 40% and particularly less than 20% in some areas. By contrast, in northern and southern China, where actual yields were relatively lower, yield gap percentages were generally larger than 40%. The areas with yield gap percentages less than 20% and less than 40% accounted for 8.2% and 27.6% of maize-growing areas, respectively. During the period, yield potentials decreased in the NCP and southwestern China due to increase in temperature and decrease in solar radiation; by contrast, increased in northern, northeastern and southeastern China due to increases in both temperature and solar radiation. Yield gap percentages decreased generally by \u223c2% per year across the major maize production regions, although increased in some areas in northern and northeastern China. The shrinking of yield gap was due to increases in actual yields and decreases in yield potentials in the NCP and southwestern China; and due to larger increases in actual yields than in yield potentials in northeastern and southeastern China.

Treatment A represented a snapshot of agronomic inputs (synthetic fertilizers N\u2013P\u2013K, manure and herbicide amounts) normally applied by the farmers in the region in 1985, when the experiment was undertaken, while treatment B consisted in a 30% reduction of synthetic and manure fertilizers and a 25% reduction of herbicide rate compared to treatment A. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of crop rotations and the reduction of inputs on maize yield and yield variability. The following conclusions can be drawn: firstly, over 26 years, the yield of grain maize in rotation increased steadily whilst the yield of continuous maize decreased slightly; secondly, a 30% reduction of agronomic inputs decreased the average yield less than proportionally for both grain and silage maize; thirdly, within a given crop rotation, grain and silage maize yields are more stable with higher inputs; and finally, yield stability of grain and silage maize increases with longer rotations.

For this purpose, five maize populations with contrasting total diferulate concentrations were evaluated four environments for performance under protected and infested conditions. Measured traits were: days to anthesis, days to silking, plant height, stalk lodging, grain moisture at harvest and grain yield. High diferulate populations showed a significant reduction in anthesis (precocity), and were 11 cm taller than the starting population, while low diferulate populations were 9 cm shorter, and showed nearly 1 t/ha lower grain yield than the original and high diferulate populations. The analysis showed that cycles of selection were positively correlated with flowering, plant height and grain yield. The infestations with borers produced >1 t/ha of reduction in grain yield; although the higher diferulate populations showed a better performance under infestation than the low diferulate populations.

However, corn rootworm resistance to Bt maize has recently been reported and spurred research on the effectiveness of Bt toxins against corn rootworm across the Corn Belt. Thus, our objectives were twofold. First, we quantified the efficacy of Bt maize hybrids against corn rootworm in South Dakota. Second, we surveyed populations of Diabrotica species in areas where Bt maize had been grown since its commercialization in 2003. Maize hybrids expressing Cry3Bb1, Cry34/35Ab1, and mCry3A were evaluated at two locations with previous corn rootworm infestations or in fields that were in continuous maize for three or more consecutive years. We reported damage to maize expressing Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A toxins. We also observed significantly higher numbers of western corn rootworm than northern corn rootworm in our Diabrotica species surveys, suggesting that western corn rootworm are the dominant species in the region.

Many tools to assist in the determination of optimum corn sidedress N rates exist, however, those that are low cost, that can be used in real time and that do not require extensive scouting or sampling may be preferred. This study compared the rates prescribed by four in-season N rate recommendation approaches: (1) the Virginia Corn Algorithm (VCA); (2) the Maize-N simulation model; (3) the Nutrient Expert for Maize (NE-Maize) model; and (4) the standard yield goal-based approach used in Virginia for N rate prescription, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and corn performance. The VCA uses canopy reflectance from pre-existing high and low N areas to determine potential response to additional N fertilizer. Maize-N generates recommendations based on crop and soil-specific input parameters as well as long-term and current season weather data. The NE-Maize model requires input of site and crop specific data, as well as the history of inputs and crop rotation and generates recommendations based on previous result from studies conducted in similar environments. The purpose of this study was to compare N rate recommendations from these various systems for performance and utility in the mid-Atlantic region. A total of seven field trials were conducted from 2012 to 2014 in Virginia each with four replications in a randomized complete block design. Treatments evaluated included a complete factorial of four different pre-plant rates (0, 45, 90, and 134\u00a0kg ha\u207b\u00b9) with the three different simulation model-prescribed rates and the yield-goal approach applied at sidedress. There were no differences in corn grain yield between the different systems or pre-plant N rate application at any location. Corn grain and stover N uptake were infrequently affected by treatment, but generally increased with increasing N rate applied, when a difference existed. Partial factor productivity (PFP) of N generally declined with increasing pre-plant N rate for all in-season N recommendation systems. The PFP for the in-season N rate recommendations generated from the VCA approach was greatest in four of seven instances with a mean of 68\u00a0kg grain kg N\u207b\u00b9.

Increasing global demand for cereals justifies questions as to where and by how much Europe\u2019s production can be increased to meet future global market demands, and how much additional nitrogen (N) crops would require. The latter is important as environmental concern and legislation are equally important as production aims in Europe. Here, we used a country-by-country, bottom-up approach to establish statistical estimates of actual grain yield, and compare these to modelled estimates of potential yields for either irrigated or rainfed conditions. In this way, we identified the yield gaps and the opportunities for increased cereal production for wheat, barley and maize, which represent 90% of the cereals grown in Europe. The combined mean annual yield gap of wheat, barley, maize was 239\u2009Mt, or 42% of the yield potential. The national yield gaps ranged between 10 and 70%, with small gaps in many north-western European countries, and large gaps in eastern and south-western Europe. Yield gaps for rainfed and irrigated maize were consistently lower than those of wheat and barley. If the yield gaps of maize, wheat and barley would be reduced from 42% to 20% of potential yields, this would increase annual cereal production by 128\u2009Mt (39%). Potential for higher cereal production exists predominantly in Eastern Europe, and half of Europe\u2019s potential increase is located in Ukraine, Romania and Poland. Unlocking the identified potential for production growth requires a substantial increase of the crop N uptake of 4.8\u2009Mt. Across Europe, the average N uptake gaps, to achieve 80% of the yield potential, were 87, 77 and 43\u2009kg N ha\u207b\u00b9 for wheat, barley and maize, respectively.

In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the \u201cBest Climate-only\u201d model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year-out) median R\u00b2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model\u2019s RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre).

Such a model trained using all data (so-called \u201cglobal model\u201d) in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model\u2019s prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states\u2019 spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R\u00b2, and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R\u00b2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model\u2019s performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies.

In the farm study, the grain yield of maize intercropped with watermelon was reduced by more than one third as compared to maize in wheat-maize double cropping, mainly due to lower ear density and lower 100-grain weight. Under real farm conditions, the yield of intercropped maize increased with increasing ear density and 100-grain weight, while yield of sole maize increased with increasing grain number per ear and 100-grain weight. In the field experiments, the maize cultivars commonly used in double cropping gave similar yields when grown in the intercropping system and their yields were closely related to ear density and 100-grain weight.

Yield stability was assessed by analyzing county yield residuals relative to average yields.Both crops had comparable yields in 1970, but showed a different yield progress (ca. 110\u202fkg ha\u207b\u00b9\u202fyear\u207b\u00b9 or 1.73 % year\u207b\u00b9 and 62\u202fkg ha\u207b\u00b9\u202fyear\u207b\u00b9 or 1.26 % year\u207b\u00b9 for maize and sorghum, respectively). Yield difference in favor to maize became more evident since late 90\u00b4s, together with the introduction of genetically modified (GM) materials in this crop. Today this consistent maize yield advantage over sorghum is observed across all regions, even those with more frequent water shortages. It also impacted in the maize area, being 6-fold larger than that of sorghum in 2016. Sorghum yield stability was traditionally higher than that of maize (maize yield relative residuals were 4\u201315 % higher than that of sorghum), but today both crops have similar yield stability in most regions. Yield progress showed comparable rates to reported genetic gains for maize (0.85\u20131.74 % year\u207b\u00b9), but not for sorghum (0.09 % year\u207b\u00b9). The contrasting investment in breeding, GM traits, and agronomy explains major differences between crops, and can be extrapolated to other countries where both crops have differential genetic yield gains.

Using the data of canopy spectral reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) for maize plants experiencing different levels of soil moisture from 2011 to 2012, the characteristics of the canopy reflective spectrum and its first derivative, and their relationships to leaf area index, were analyzed. Soil moisture of the control group was about 75% while that of the drought stress treatment was about 45%. In addition, LAI retrieval models for maize were established using vegetation indices (VIs) and principal component analysis (PCA) and the models were tested using independent datasets representing different soil water contents and different developmental stages of maize. The results showed that canopy spectral reflectances were in accordance with the characteristics of green plants, under both drought stress and at different developmental stages. In the visible band, canopy reflectance for both healthy and damaged vegetation had a green-wavelength peak and a red-wavelength valley; reflectance under drought stress, especially in the green peak (about 550nm) and the red valley (about 676nm) was higher than in the control group. In the near-infrared band, the canopy spectral reflectance decreased substantially between 780 and 1350nm under drought stress. Moreover, the red edge of the spectrum was shifted toward blue wavelengths. The first derivative spectrum showed a double peak phenomenon at the edge of the red band at different developmental stages: the main peak appeared between 728 and 732nm and the minor peak at about 718nm. The double peaks become more obvious through the growth and development of the maize, with the most notable effect during the silking and milk stages, after which it gradually decreased. During maize growth, the LAI of all plants, regardless of soil moisture conditions, increased, and the largest LAI also occurred during the silking and milk stages. During those stages, the LAI of plants under different drought stress levels was significantly lower (by 20% or more) than in normal plants with sufficient water supplies. The LAI was highly significantly correlated with canopy spectral reflectance in the bands from 350nm to 510nm, from 571nm to 716nm, and from 1450nm to 1575nm. Also, the LAI was significantly correlated with red edge parameters and several VIs.

The natural variability of leaf area per corn plant was nearly 10%. Additional variability or experimental error may be introduced by the measurement technique employed and by nonuniformity within the plot. Direct measurement of leaf area with an electronic area meter had the lowest coefficient of variance (CV), required that the fewest plants be sampled, but required approximately the same amount of time as the leaf area/weight ratio method to detect comparable differences. Indirect methods based on measurements of length and width of leaves required more plants but less total time than the direct method. Unless the coefficients for converting length and width to area are verified frequently, the indirect methods may be biased. When true differences in LAI among treatments exceed 50% of mean, all four methods are equal.

Then, the grey relational analysis (GRA) method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used to determine the weight coefficients of the VTCI and LAI at four maize growth stages (the emergence-jointing, jointing-booting, booting-filling and filling-mature stages). Thus, an integrated maize growth monitoring index (G) was formulated for maize growth estimation at the main growth stage. Linear regression models between maize yields and G values for counties in five cities of the Hebei Plain from 2010 to 2015 were constructed to verify and analyze the precision of maize growth monitoring. The weight coefficients of the VTCI and LAI varied at the four growth stages. In Cangzhou City, the LAI weight coefficient at the jointing-booting stage was the highest, followed by the VTCI at the booting-filling stage, indicating that maize growth conditions and yields were highly correlated with vegetation coverage at the jointing-booting stage and that maize growth was most sensitive to water stress at the booting-filling stage. Linear regression models between G values and maize yields for the counties in the five cities all passed the significance test at the 0.01 level. Moreover, the correlation between G values and maize yields was closer than that between maize yields and VTCI or LAI alone and illustrated a high accuracy of the integrated maize monitoring results derived from the synthetic approach combining the two indices.

Over the past few decades, with the development of eddy covariance technology, the carbon fluxes of farmlands have been determined in many countries. However, studies are very limited for drip irrigation maize the arid regions in northwestern China, which covers a large area where a mixed mode of agriculture and grazing is practiced. RESULTS: To study the effects of drip irrigation on the net ecosystem productivity (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP) and net biome productivity (NBP) in the arid regions of northwestern China, we measured the carbon flux annually from 2014 to 2018 using an eddy covariance system. Our results showed that the maize field carbon flux exhibited single-peak seasonal patterns during the growing seasons. During 2014\u20132018, the NEE, ER and GPP of the drip-irrigated maize field ranged between \u2212\u2009407\u2009~\u2009\u2212\u2009729\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u207b\u00b2, 485.46\u2009~\u2009975.46\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u207b\u00b2, and 1068.23\u2009~\u20091705.30\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u207b\u00b2. In four of the 5 study years, the ER released back to the atmosphere was just over half of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis. The mean daily NEE, ER and GPP were significantly correlated with the net radiation (Rn), air temperature (Ta), leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (SWC). The results of path analysis showed that leaf area index is the main driving force of seasonal variation of carbon flux. When harvested removals were considered, the annual NBP was \u2212\u2009234\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u207b\u00b2, and the drip-irrigated maize field was a carbon source. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the variation and influencing factors of NEE, ER and GPP in the growth period of spring maize under film drip irrigation in arid areas of northwest China. The ecosystem was a carbon sink before maize harvest, but it was converted into a carbon source considering the carbon emissions after harvest. The variation of carbon flux was influenced by both environmental and vegetation factors, and its leaf area index was the main driver that affects the seasonal variation of carbon flux."}, "329111": {"title": "Critical nitrogen curve and nitrogen nutrition index for spring maize in north-east china", "abstract": "The study was conducted at three sites during 2008 and 2009 in the North-East China Plain (NECP).

These N treatments created a range of N deficiencies at flowering. There was no indication that yield response to the timing of N application had changed over the past 70 years of hybrid improvement.

The reasons for the lower grain yield in 0_220, but not 55_165, appeared to be 1) low vegetative-stage N accumulation which could not be compensated for by increased post-silking N uptake, 2) lack of recovery of leaf N status following the R1 N application, and 3) significantly reduced biomass accumulation during the vegetative growth.

The data including the weight of dry mass (W) and N concentration of entire plant and ear, post-anthesis plant N uptake (PANU) from soil, grain number (GN), and grain weight (GW) were collected on wheat (two cultivars) and maize (three cultivars) from eight N rates (0\u2013300\u2009kg N ha\u207b\u00b9) field experiments.

GN and GW of maize and wheat showed significantly positive correlation with NNI\u209a at anthesis and NNIE at maturity under N-limiting treatments, and GN and GW could keep relatively stable under non-N limiting treatments. NNI\u209a and NNIE showed the potential capacity to predict GN and GW of maize and wheat under N limiting condition. Ear critical N accumulation (NAcE) was calculated using ear Nc curve to investigate the differences mechanism of NAE under different N conditions. The difference of NAcE under different N treatments was deduced from the pre-anthesis N status of maize and wheat by determining GN. The ear N deficiency (NDE) between NAcE and NAE was co-regulated by plant pre-anthesis and post-anthesis N status, which in turn have potential to explain the variance of GW at maturity in both crops. The significantly attenuated effect of pre-anthesis N deficiency on ear potential N demand in maize and wheat indicated that the post-anthesis N management must consider the pre-anthesis N status and the corresponding reduction of the post-anthesis N input to prevent N loss under N limiting treatment in both crops. Maize was more dependent on post-anthesis N status while wheat was more reliant on pre-anthesis N status for satisfying ear growth and producing optimum GN owing to the differential values of PANU/NAE in maize and wheat during post-anthesis period.

N concentration of leaf-blades was negatively affected by PD, but this reduction was attenuated by N rates, especially in late SD (N x PD x SD interaction). Hence, in early SD, some data of both Hs corresponding to 270 N yielded low SPAD values for NNI greater than 0.86. Consequently, crop N status was better reflected by NNI than by SPAD readings, because NNI considers N stored in the whole plant.

To examine the effect of silicon on transpiration, changes in stomata opening were compared between Si-treated and nontreated leaves by measuring transpiration rate and leaf resistance. The results showed that the reduction in transpiration following the application of silicon was largely due to a reduction in transpiration rate through stomata, indicating that silicon influences stomata movement. In xylem sap of plants treated with 2 mmol L(-1) silicic acid, the Si concentration was 200-fold higher, while the Ca concentration which is mainly determined by the transpiration rate, was 2.5-fold lower than that of plants grown without Si. Furthermore, the water flow rate in xylem vessels of plants with and without Si was compared.

Seedling emergence of velvetleaf and johnsongrass were modeled using three different approaches: (1) thermal time calculated assuming 5 C as base temperature for both species; (2) thermal time using the specific estimated base temperatures; and (3) hydrothermal time using the specific, estimated base temperatures and water potentials. All the species had base temperatures greater than 10 C, with the exception of velvetleaf (3.9 to 4.4 C) and common lambsquarters (2.0 to 2.6 C). All species showed a calculated base-water potential equal or up to \u2212\u22121.00 MPa. The thresholds of the two ecotypes were similar for all the studied species, with the exception of redroot pigweed, for which the Veneto ecotype showed a water potential lower than \u2212\u22120.41 MPa, whereas it was \u2212\u22120.62 MPa for the Tuscany ecotype. Similar thresholds have been found to be useful in hydrothermal time models covering two climatic regions where maize is grown in Italy. Furthermore, a comparison between the use of specific, estimated, and common thresholds for modeling weed emergence showed that, for a better determination of weed control timing, it is often necessary to estimate the specific thresholds.Nomenclature: Barnyardgrass, Echinochloa crus-galli (L.)

A 2-yr field experiment was conducted on a Drummer silty clay loam (fine silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haplaquoll) at the Agronomy and Plant Pathology South Farm of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Treatments consisted of planting date (early May and early June) and soil temperature surrounding the corn growing point (5\u00b0C below ambient, ambient, and 5\u00b0C above ambient). Soil temperature was controlled using warm and cool water circulating through copper pipes buried next to the corn rows. Air temperatures were not controlled. Irrigation was used. The experimental design was a split plot in a randomized complete block with four replications. Ten plants were randomly selected within each replication and nondestructive measures of plant stage, individual leaf area, and leaf senescence were taken three times per week from emergence to V5, and once per week afterwards until complete leaf senescence. Growing degree days (GDD) were calculated using the modified growing degree day formula (MGDD). From planting to V5, MGDD were computed using the soil maximum and minimum daily temperatures from each treatment. After the soil temperature treatments were terminated, the MGDD calculations were based on maximum and minimum daily air temperatures. Lower early-season soil temperature delayed corn development and modified individual leaf area. Plants under these cooler conditions went through vegetative developmental stages faster per unit of accumulated MGDD, showing the effect of temperature on corn ontogeny. The results also show that the current method of calculating MGDD (with base temperature of 10\u00b0C) does not adequately predict corn development under exceptionally warm or exceptionally cool soils. Warmer early-season soil temperature linearly increased corn yield (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.14 Mg ha\u207b\u00b9 \u00b0C\u207b\u00b9).

In wheat, the ratio of shoot:root dry matter partitioning decreased at low RZT, whereas the opposite was true for maize. In both species, dry matter partitioning to the shoot was one-sidedly increased when the shoot base temperature, and thus shoot activity, were increased at low RZT. The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the shoots and roots were higher at low in comparison to high RZT in both species, irrespective of the shoot base temperature. The concentrations of nitrogen (N) in the shoot and root fresh matter also increased at low RZT with the exception of maize grown at 12 degrees C RZT and 20 degrees C shoot base temperature. The ratio of NSC:N was increased in both species at low RZT. However this ratio was negatively correlated with the ratio of shoot:root dry matter partitioning in wheat, but positively correlated in maize. It is suggested that dry matter partitioning between shoot and roots at low RZT is not causally related to the internal nitrogen or carbohydrate status of the plants.

In the model, rate of development towards a specified stage (e.g. flowering) for a given genotype is composed of three components: the genotype's maximum rate of development; any delay due to a non-optimal temperature; and any delay due to a photoperiod response. It is assumed that development to the specified stage is an autonomous process established by most, if not all, genes other than the vernalization genes and the photoperiod genes; and that this autonomous process is delayed by any activity of the photoperiod genes. Since all physiological processes are modulated by temperature, any photoperiod response is inevitably a photoperiod x temperature interaction. This interaction is simulated by assuming that the photoperiod gene activity occurs only beyond a critical photoperiod (Pc) and is enlarged by temperature above a base temperature (Tbp) that allows the photoperiod gene activity. The model is written as R = 1/Db-St(T-Topt)2-Sp(T-Tbp)/P-Pc/, where R is the expected rate of development to the specified stage under any combination of temperature (T) and photoperiod (P). The other model parameters are: Sp, the sensitivity to a delaying photoperiod; Topt, the optimum temperature for development in the absence of the photoperiod response; St, the sensitivity to a non-optimum temperature; and Db, the basic duration to the specified stage (or intrinsic earliness), the inverse of which is the maximum rate of development. Db is observable only if T = Topt and simultaneously P greater than or equal to Pc for long-day plants (LDP) but P less than or equal to Pc for short-day plants (SDP). The model is shown to successfully simulate and predict the published phenological data of five crops, viz. long-day plants: pea (Pisum sativum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and short-day plants: bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.)."}, "7287206": {"title": "Modeling impacts of climate change on the water needs and growing cycle of crops in three Mediterranean basins", "abstract": "In this study, the suitability of major crops currently growing in three case study basins in Catalonia (NE Spain) was assessed for the first half of the 21st century.

Climate change impacts were estimated at sub-basin level using temperature and precipitation temporal series based on the Third Report on Climate Change in Catalonia under the RCP4.5 scenario. Potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc, FAO procedure) and monthly water balance considering soil water holding capacity were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and NHN. Over the period studied, NHN would generally rise, with small (+\u00a00.1%) to high (+\u00a06.6%) increases in the 2020\u00a0s and moderate (+\u00a03.9%) to high (+\u00a06.7%) increases in the 2040\u00a0s. Dynamics would be different for the three basins and general trends vary from crop to crop. At all events, a generalized increase in NHN together with lower water availability could severely limit crop productivity in the case of both rainfed and irrigated crops (irrigation restrictions). Phenological changes could represent a greater constraint for crop productivity. Overall, the number of frost days will decrease (from \u22120.1 days in March to \u22128.7 days in April) in the three basins, while extremely hot days will increase (from +\u00a00.3 days in July to +\u00a03.8 days in August).

They are also increasingly important for accurate crop yield simulation, but they are affected by various environmental factors. In this study, the RUE and HI of winter wheat and their relationships to canopy spectral reflectance were investigated based on the massive field measurements of five nitrogen (N) treatments. Crop production can be separated into light interception and RUE. The results indicated that during a long period of slow growth from emergence to regreening, the effect of N on crop production mainly showed up in an increased light interception by the canopy. During the period of rapid growth from regreening to maturity, it was present in both light interception and RUE. The temporal variations of RUEAPAR (aboveground biomass produced per unit of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy) during the period from regreening to maturity had different patterns corresponding to the N deficiency, N adequacy and N-excess conditions. Moreover, significant relationships were found between the RUEAPAR and the accumulative normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the integrated season (R\u00b2=0.68), between the HI and the accumulative NDVI after anthesis (R\u00b2=0.89), and between the RUEgrain (ratio of grain yield to the total amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy) and the accumulative NDVI of the whole season (R\u00b2=0.89) and that after anthesis (R\u00b2=0.94).

A shortage of N can give three responses: (1) reduce leaf area (light capture) and maintain leaf N content (photosynthetic capacity); (2) maintain leaf area and reduce leaf N content; or (3) a combination of these responses. We examined these responses in contrasting crop canopies. Forage rape (C3 dicotyledons), wheat (C3 monocotyledons) and forage sorghum (C4 monocotyledons) were grown with fertiliser N supplies of 0, 50, 100 or 200kgN/ha. Crop biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception were measured regularly, while accumulated intercepted PAR and radiation use efficiency (RUE) were calculated. Each crop exhibited distinct functional responses of biomass production to N shortage. For all crops specific leaf N (SLN), RUE, LAI and PAR capture were reduced in response to N shortage. However, the extent of the response differed between species. The SLN and RUE were reduced to a greater extent in forage rape than in wheat. In contrast, the LAI and PAR capture were reduced to a greater extent in wheat than in forage rape. Sorghum was intermediate between these two crops. Leaf inclination could account for these distinct responses \u2013 with forage rape's more horizontally inclined leaves, a change in LAI has a much smaller effect on PAR interception compared with wheat and sorghum. Under N shortage the amount of PAR intercepted per unit leaf N increased in forage rape but not in the other two crops. Alternatively leaf structure could account for these distinct responses \u2013 forage rape has larger petioles and midribs than wheat. Petioles and midribs have a large N content but only a small area, therefore to achieve given RUE, forage rape requires an extra 1.2gN/m2 leaf than wheat. Therefore the functional response that maximised growth under limited N supply was to reduce SLN and RUE to a greater extent than LAI and PAR interception for forage rape; reduce LAI and PAR interception to a greater extent than SLN and RUE for wheat; and reduce both RUE and LAI for sorghum to a similar extent.

However, significant differences were observed between different planting patterns with respect to the amount of PAR intercepted by plants that were 60-80cm above the ground surface (53.35-225.16%). This result was mainly due to the changes in the vertical distributions of leaf area index (LAI). As a result, the effects of the planting patterns on RUE and the winter wheat yield were due the vertical distribution of PAR in the winter wheat canopies.

The forage biomass derived from clipping varied greatly between seasons (from 0.8 to 3.3tha\u22121 dry matter) in response to the notable inter-seasonal variability in weather conditions. Cultivar Senatore Cappelli showed good recovery following clipping, with the ability to attain almost complete radiation interception well before anthesis. The high number of leaves that emerged after clipping might have contributed to this good recovery. Nevertheless, clipping reduced the dry matter produced by anthesis (16tha\u22121 in clipped compared to 21tha\u22121 in unclipped crops) as well as the final dry matter (DMMAT) (19tha\u22121 in clipped compared to 23tha\u22121 in unclipped crops), although these differences disappeared when the clipped biomass was included. The lower lodging observed at anthesis in the clipped (21%) compared with unclipped crops (63%) likely reduced the difference between treatments. The lower DMMAT of clipped treatments was reflected in a lower grain yield (GY) (3.4tha\u22121vs 4.2tha\u22121 in the unclipped treatment). Clipping did not affect the amount of nitrogen present in the biomass, nitrogen uptake efficiency or radiation use efficiency. GY reduction after clipping was mediated by the reduction in spikes m\u22122 and kernels m\u22122 (KNO). Spike fertility was not affected by clipping, because the same amount of radiation was available for each spike (about 1MJ). The period with reduced ground cover after clipping was reflected in an increased evaporation and reduced transpiration, which did not alter the total water used and increased the transpiration efficiency in terms of DMMAT.Old tall durum wheat cultivars manifested good suitability for dual-purpose use in environments with low attainable yields because their low grain yield potential contributed to reducing the negative effects of clipping on GY.

Wheat was grown in two sowing patterns: (1) tridimensional uniform sowing (U); (2) conventional drilling (D). Four planting densities were used: 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, and 4.5 million plants ha\u22121. Several indices were measured to compare the wheat canopies: photosynthetic active radiation intercepted by the canopy (IPAR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), canopy extinction coefficient (K), and RUE. In two sowing patterns, the K values decreased with increasing planting density, but the K values of U were lower than that of D. LMA and IPAR were higher for U than for D, whereas LAI was nearly the same for both sowing patterns. IPAR and LAI increased with increasing density under the same sowing pattern. However, the difference in IPAR and LAI between the 3.6 and 4.5 million plants ha\u22121 treatments was not significant for both sowing patterns. Therefore, LAI within the same planting density was not affected by sowing pattern. RUE was the largest for the U mode with a planting density of 3.6 million plants ha\u22121 treatment. For the D sowing pattern, the lowest planting density (1.8 million plants ha\u22121) resulted in the highest yield. Light radiation interception was minimal for the D mode with a planting density of 1.8 million plants ha\u22121 treatment, but the highest RUE and highest yield were observed under this condition. For the U sowing pattern, IPAR increased with increasing planting density, but yield and RUE were the highest with a planting density of 3.6 million plants ha\u22121. These results indicated that the optimal planting density for improving the canopy light environment differed between the sowing patterns. The effect of sowing pattern\u00d7planting density interaction on grain yield, yield components, RUE, IPAR, and LMA was significant (P<0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that there is a positive significant correlation between grain yield and RUE (r=0.880, P<0.01), LMA (r=0.613, P<0.05), and spike number (r=0.624, P<0.05). These results demonstrated that the tridimensional uniform sowing technique, particularly at a planting density of 3.6 million plants ha\u22121, can effectively increase light interception and utilization and unit leaf area. This leads to the production of more photosynthetic products that in turn lead to significantly increased spike number (P<0.05), kernel number, grain weight, and an overall increase in yield."}, "6136030": {"title": "Decreased wheat grain yield stimulation by free air CO2 enrichment under N deficiency is strongly related to decreased radiation use efficiency enhancement", "abstract": "Uncertainty still exists about the extent and mechanisms of yield stimulation by elevated atmospheric CO\u2082 (e[CO\u2082]) in wheat.

Yield stimulation was primarily due to enhanced grain number. With increasing N supply, peak values of green area index were increased under e[CO\u2082] by 4 up to 22%, while AR was unaffected. RUE was increased by both rising SLNW, which depended on N supply, and e[CO\u2082] and the RUE increase was larger under Nad (+20%) and Nex (+18%) than under Nd (+6%). SLNW was decreased by e[CO\u2082] and this decrease was very similar among N levels (\u223c\u22126%).

Even though the unfertilized F-W-W-hay (H)-H-H system had low available P, it maintained stubble wheat yields at a generally constant level (decline of 0.08 bu/acre/yr) due to low soil erosion and because the haycontaining system markedly increased N-supplying power of the soil. The addition of N and P fertilizer at rates based on soil tests resulted in a positive divergence in yield trends of wheat grown on stubble in F-W-W and continuous wheat systems as both available N and P were maintained at a high level. Legumes probably will require added P if they are to sustain crop production in a manner similar to that provided by responsible use of fertilizers. Research QuestionHow important is proper fertilizer management for maintaining cereal yields in the long term? Will the inclusion of legume green manure or hay crops in rotation with cereals maintain crop production without addition of fertilizer? These are important questions for producers and society in the development of sustainable crop production systems. Objectives of this study were to determine the long-term impact on yield trends of hard red spring wheat when N and P are applied, compared with applying no fertilizers to: (i) monoculture continuous wheat, (ii) monoculture wheat grown in a fallow system, (iii) legume green manure-wheat, and (iv) legume grass (hay)-wheat systems. Literature SummaryProponents of organic farming and low-input sustainable agriculture allege inorganic fertilizers degrade soil. They recommend use of legumes to provide N, and crop rotations and tillage to reduce pests and weeds. Because legumes do not supply P, systems relying solely on legumes for maintaining soil fertility will eventually become impoverished and yields will decline. In contrast, research has shown that if inorganic fertilizers are applied according to soil tests where cereals are grown annually, soil organic matter and the N-supplying power of soils are maintained as effectively as when legumes are included in rotations. The experiment was carried out over 34 yr (1958-1991) on a thin Black Chernozem (Udic Haploboroll) heavy clay soil, at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, Canada. Rotation studies were fertilized (N and P) and unfertilized fallow-wheat-wheat and continuous wheat, and unfertilized sweetclover green manure-wheat-wheat and fallow-wheat-wheat-hay-hay-hay (Table 1). Hay was bromegrass-alfalfa mixture. The legumes were seeded together with the preceding wheat crop. All phases of each rotation were present every year. Field-size equipment was used for all operations, with tillage and herbicides used to control weeds. Applied QuestionsHow important is proper fertilizer management for maintaining cereal yields in the long term? Yields of wheat grown on stubble (stubble-wheat) were increased by fertilizer in both the 3-yr and continuous wheat systems (Table 2), particularly in later years when soil tests were used to determine N requirements. These yield increases reflected the concomitant increases in N-supplying power and P availability of the soil due to addition of fertilizers (Table 2). When no fertilizer was applied, wheat grown on fallow showed no trend (data not shown), but yields of stubble-wheat declined steadily at an average rate of 0.41 bu/acre/yr (Table 2). This probably was related to a depletion in soil N-supplying power and P availability (Table 2) caused by soil erosion in fallow years and net export of N and P in harvested grain. Without addition of fertilizers, there was a slight decline (0.16 bu/acre/yr) in yields of continuous wheat, but this was significantly less than that of stubble-wheat yields in the fallow system, reflecting less erosion and higher N-supplying power of the annually cropped system. Will the inclusion of legume green manure or hay crops in rotation with cereals maintain crop production without addition of fertilizer? Legume green manure increased stubble-wheat yields compared to those of unfertilized fallow-wheat-wheat because the fixed N increased N-supplying power of the soil. Because legumes supply no P, however, yields of the green manure system still trended downwards with time at a rate similar to unfertilized fallow-wheat-wheat (Table 2). The hay crop, despite the removal of forage in 3 of every 6 yr, enhanced stubble-wheat yields more than those in the unfertilized fallow-wheat-wheat and green manure-wheat-wheat systems, but yields were not as high as that of well-fertilized monoculture wheat. The hay system performed well because it is subject to less erosion than all systems except continuous wheat, and because it markedly increased the N-supplying power of soil (Table 2). It was not as effective as well-fertilized monoculture wheat systems, in part because the hay supplies no extra P. It is also possible that hay did not fix as much N as that applied to monoculture wheat as fertilizers, but this was not determined in this study. RecommendationsIn subhumid Great Plains soils, monoculture wheat, if properly managed, is a more sustainable system than including legumes in rotation with wheat without fertilizer P being added. Summerfallowing should be minimized on these soils because it degrades soil fertility causing yields of stubble-wheat to decline over time. Table 1Fertilizer treatments over 34 yr.

This is the first study in Poland to focus on variables besides those used in GWP calculations and those influencing the yield-scaled GWP variability of winter wheat production. Identification of these variables contributes to the creation of more environmentally friendly wheat cropping systems. In this study, regression-tree based analysis revealed that soil quality and water availability during crucial stages of plant growth are the most influential input variables of the yield-scaled GWP and yield variability in winter wheat production. Not surprisingly, environmentally favorable conditions for wheat growth contribute to its high yields yet require less intensified agronomic management. The strong influence of water availability in June and July, at the end of plant growth, applies to the undesirable effect of excess water leading to plant diseases which result in lower yield.

The objective of our study was to determine the annual genetic gain for grain yield (GY) of the internationally distributed Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trials, grown during 2002\u20132003 to 2013\u20132014 and developed by the Bread Wheat Breeding program at the CIMMYT. We analyzed data from 740 locations across 66 countries, which were classified in low-yielding (LYE) and medium-yielding (MYE) environments according to a cluster analysis. The rate of GY increase (GYC) was estimated relative to four drought-tolerant wheat lines used as constant checks. Our results estimate that the rate of GYC in LYE was 1.8% (38.13 kg ha\u207b\u00b9 yr\u207b\u00b9), whereas in MYE, it was 1.41% (57.71 kg ha\u207b\u00b9 yr\u207b\u00b9). The increase in GYC across environments was 1.6% (48.06 kg ha\u207b\u00b9 yr\u207b\u00b9). The pedigrees of the highest yielding lines through the coefficient of parentage analysis indicated the utilization of three primary sources\u2014\u2018Pastor\u2019, \u2018Baviacora 92\u2019, and synthetic hexaploid derivatives\u2014to develop drought-tolerant, high and stably performing wheat lines.

Control methods are available, but farmers are often reluctant to spray insecticides or fungicides when returns on investment are uncertain and profits are limited. Two studies were conducted to determine the impact of insecticide or two different fungicide applications on wheat yield and return on investment. Rather than directly increasing yield, these chemicals preserve the yield through reducing losses. One study used pyraclostrobin fungicide to control foliar disease and pyrethroid insecticide to control insect pests that are vectors of viral diseases; a second study used prothioconazole fungicide to control fungal diseases. Yield and economics of production were determined in both studies. Use of insecticide preserved wheat yield an average of 5 bu/acre, with an average increase in return on investment of $22.53/acre/year. Response to pyraclostrobin fungicide showed greater variability than use of insecticide, preserving yield 6.4 bu/acre with an average increase in profitability of $20.90/year. Net return increased in 2 of the 3 yr when this foliar fungicide was used. Use of prothioconazole fungicide preserved wheat yields in both years, with an average benefit of 20 bu/acre and an increased profit of more than $76/acre. While all treatments preserved wheat yield, the response depended on the year and was primarily a function of the rainfall received during the spring.

Comparing current and historical yields in Denmark is possible because yield potential has been documented throughout history. However, the current national winter wheat yield map solely uses soil properties within the model. The aim of this study was to generate a new Danish winter wheat yield map and compare the results to historical yield potential. Utilizing random forest with soil, climate, and topography variables, a winter wheat yield map was generated from 876 field trials carried out from 1992 to 2018. The random forest model performed better than the model based only on soil. The updated national yield map was then compared to yield potential maps from 1688 and 1844. While historical time periods are characterized by numerous low yield potential areas and few highly productive areas, current yield is evenly distributed between low and high yields. Advances in technology and farm practices have exceeded historical yield predictions, mainly due to the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and drainage.

As the milling yield increased, the wheat flour showed low quality on physicochemical properties in general. Significant differences in proximate analysis, color, solvent retention capacity, pasting property, and antioxidant activity were observed as the yield increased to maximize the production of wheat flour from wheat kernels. Adding clear flour and shorts did not significantly affect the quality of the wheat flour in comparison with straight flour samples. However, as brans were added to the flour portion, the wheat flour quality parameters decreased significantly in color, solvent retention capacity, and pasting properties. On the other hand, antioxidant properties increased as brans were added. Maximizing wheat flour yield is a key to minimizing the production cost of Korean wheat flour, which is approximately three times more expensive than imported wheat flour.

Here, we provide an analysis based on a survey of 250 fields from 2015 to 2018 inclusive. Biotic factors, nutrients and crop yields are all monitored. Crop models were calibrated locally at each site. Regression and Classification Trees (RCART) were used to determine the key drivers of the yield gap in wheat, and again used to identify attributes contributing to a yield gap for a field regardless of crop type. The mean yield gap from 697 wheat crops, collected over 4 years, was 1.03 t/ha (MSE =2.23 t/ha). This equated to a mean wheat yield gap of 20.3 % \u00b1 S.D 36.2 %. 18 % of fields had repeated yield gaps of 20 % or more, irrespective of crop type. The RCART analysis demonstrated that for wheat, the yield potential of the crop was the most important predictor, where fields with high yield potentials were most likely to have a higher yield gap. Nitrogen was the second most important predictor. Yield gaps of wheat crops grown in high yielding regions were also related to crop rotation, leaf diseases and weed populations. In low rainfall zones, wheat yield gaps were related to the presence of soil pathogens including Pratylenchus sp., Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp. In conclusion, yield potential and nitrogen are important predictors of the yield gap. Increasing nitrogen inputs would address the yield gap in 25 % of wheat crops. In 22 % of wheat crops, increasing nitrogen inputs will not correct the gap, as other biotic stresses are often present, that require sophisticated agronomic intervention.

The greatest grain yield and stability occurred from combinations of the earliest seeding dates, high seeding rate, and shallow seeding depth; wheat line did not influence grain yield. Grain protein content was greater at later seeding dates; however, the greater grain yield at earlier seeding dates resulted in more protein production per unit area.

RESULTS: Wheat production in China has increased over the past four decades. Under the sole impact of climate change, wheat yield generally decreased (\u22125.45 to +1.09%\u00a0decade\u207b\u00b9). Crop management increased the wheat yield from 7.11 to 19.94%\u00a0decade\u207b\u00b9. Sensitivities of wheat yield to climatic variables (average temperature, accumulated sunshine hours, accumulated precipitation) were spatially heterogeneous; notably, in spring\u2010wheat planting areas, wheat yield was more susceptible to the negative impact of warming. In terms of relative contribution, the contribution of climate change to spring wheat yield was \u221224.08% to \u22125.41%, and the contribution to winter wheat was \u22124.98% to +34.69%.

Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to assess the performance of GLAI data assimilation in light of uncertainty in the model parameters that govern the GLAI simulation. When considering this uncertainty, assimilation of GLAI by \"updating\" and by \"forcing\" was able to reduce error between measured and simulated canopy weight and ET by 43.6% and 56.5% and by 45.0% and 51.6%, respectively, as compared to the stand-alone model.

Since the LAI magnitude was obviously underestimated however its spatial pattern was relatively well captured by remote sensing, we developed a novel spatial assimilation scheme that assimilated the spatial differences instead of the absolute values of LAI into crop model. Firstly, we retrieved the information of critical development stages of winter wheat from remote sensing data to adjust the simulation of phenology by MCWLA-Wheat model; then the spatial differences of LAI derived from remote sensing were assimilated into the MCWLA-Wheat model using a kind of constant gain Kalman Filter algorithm to improve the ability of the model in estimating winter wheat LAI and yields at regional scale in the North China Plain.

The indicators can be used to adapt dry matter production of crop simulators to N-limited growth conditions. The first indicator, nitrogen factor (NFAC), originates from the CERES-Wheat model and calculates the critical N concentration of the shoot as a function of phenological development. The second indicator, N nutrition index (NNI), calculates a critical N concentration as a function of shoot dry matter. The third indicator, specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) index (SLNI), has been newly developed. It compares the actual SLN with the maximum SLN (SLN\u2098\u2090\u2093). The latter is calculated as a function of the green area index (GAI). The comparison was based on growth curves and fitted to empirical data, and was carried out independently from a dynamic crop model. The data set included four growing seasons (2004\u20132006, 2012) in Northern Germany and seven modern bread wheat cultivars with varying N fertilization levels (0\u2013320 kg N/ha). The influence of N shortage on LUE was evaluated from the beginning of stem elongation until flowering. With the exception of 2005, the highest productivity was observed for the highest N level. A moderate N shortage primarily reduced GAI and therefore light interception, while LUE remained stable under moderate N shortage. The relative LUE (rLUE) of a specific day was defined as the ratio of actual to maximal LUE. None of the indicators was proportional to rLUE, but the relationships were described well by quadratic plateau curves. The correlation between simulated and measured rLUE was significant for all explanatory indicators, but different in terms of mean absolute error and coefficient of determination (R \u00b2). The performance of SLNI and NNI was similar, but the goodness of prediction was much lower for NFAC. Compared with NNI and NFAC, SLNI corresponded to leaf N and was therefore sensitive to N translocation from leaves to growing grains during the reproductive stage. For this reason, SLNI may have the potential to improve simulation of dry matter production in wheat crop simulators."}, "5334838": {"title": "LiDAR based biomass and crop nitrogen estimates for rapid, non-destructive assessment of wheat nitrogen status", "abstract": "Optical remote sensing of crop nitrogen (N) status is developing into a powerful diagnostic tool that can improve N management decisions.

However, because the spectral signal measured by traditional optical remote sensing devices during early crop development is often dominated by soil spectral reflectance, early season estimates of W and %Na are prone to large errors. Terrestrial LiDAR (light detection and ranging) scanning (TLS) may alleviate errors as fine scale TLS point data can be used to directly quantify physical W proxies (e.g., crop height or volume) and derive %Na from green (532nm) TLS point return intensity.

The results showed that stomatal conductance (g) and transpiration (E) of wheat were very sensitive to root pruning. After root pruning, they declined rapidly and but returned to pre-pruning values 15 days after treatment. Under well-watered conditions, there was no significant difference in leaf water potential (\u03c8leaf) between root pruned and control plants after root pruning. Under moderate drought stress, \u03c8leaf of root pruned plants declined significantly compared to the control 3 days after root pruning. After 15 days, \u03c8leaf of root pruned plants was similar to the controls. Under different soil moisture levels, net assimilation rate (A) of root pruned plants was lower than controls 3-7 days after root pruning, but was similar to the controls 15 days after pruning. At anthesis (50 days after root pruning), root pruned plants showed significantly higher A compared with the control. Leaf area per tiller and tiller number of root pruning plants was significant lower than the control at booting stage, which showed that root pruning restrained the growth of plants in the early growing stage, but leaf area per stem, of root pruned plants, was similar to the control at anthesis. Under both soil moisture levels, there was no significant difference in grain yield between root pruned and the control plants in the monoculture. In mixture with the control plants, the root pruned plants was less productive and had a lower relative yield (0.92 and 0.78, respectively) compared with the control (1.13 and 1.19, respectively), which suggested that the pruned plants lost some of its competing ability and showed a lower ability to acquire and use the same resources in the mixture compared with the control plant. Over the whole growing cycle, root pruning reduced water consumption (by 10% under well-watered conditions and 16% under moderate drought stress) of wheat significantly compared to the control (P < 0.05), and but there was no significant difference in grain yield between root pruned and control plants.

Consequently, a major research challenge is to devise cropping systems that maximize water-use efficiency (WUE). In a long-term trial in northern Syria (1986-1998) we compared the effects of seven wheat-based rotations on soil water dynamics and WUE in both the wheat and non-wheat phase. The cropping systems were durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) in rotation with fallow, watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), lentil (Lens culinaris), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), vetch (Vicia sativa), medic pasture (Medicago spp.), and wheat. Seasonal recharge/discharge were identified using the neutron probe. Depth of wetting varied with seasonal rainfall (233-503 mm). Based on crop yields, WUE was calculated for each cropping option in relation to the durum wheat crop. The greatest limitation to growth was the supply of water and not the soil moisture storage potential. Wheat grain yield was dictated by the extent to which the alternative crops in the rotation dried out the soil profile, in addition to seasonal rainfall and its distribution. Chickpea and medic extracted as much water as continuous wheat. Wheat after these crops was solely dependent on current seasonal rainfall, but fallow, lentil, watermelon, and vetch did not deplete soil moisture to the same extent, leaving some residual soil moisture for the succeeding wheat crop. This difference in soil water resulted in a significant difference in wheat yield and hence WUE, which decreased in the following crop rotation sequence: fallow, medic, lentil, chickpea, and continuous wheat. However, on the system basis, the wheat/lentil or wheat/vetch systems were most efficient at using rainfall, producing 27% more grain than the wheat/fallow, while the wheat/chickpea system was as efficient as wheat/fallow system, with continuous wheat being least efficient. With N added to the cereal phase, system WUE of the system increased, being least for continuous wheat and greatest for wheat/lentil. Wheat-legume rotation systems with additional N input in the wheat phase not only can maintain sustainable production system, but also are more efficient in utilizing limited rainfall."}, "719741": {"title": "Effects of root pruning on competitive ability and water use efficiency in winter wheat", "abstract": "This study was conducted to assess the effect of root system size and vertical distribution on competitive ability and water use efficiency (WUE) by root pruning at the stem elongation stage.

Root pruning succeeded in reducing root dry weight in the upper soil (0-20cm soil layer), resulting in diminished total root weight in root pruned wheat (p <0.05). Root pruning restrained stomatal conductance and transpiration of wheat at the stem elongation stage. However, both stomatal conductance and transpiration in root pruned plants were higher than those in control plants at the anthesis and grain filling stages. Root pruned wheat plants had a higher photosynthetic and lower root respiration rate than wheat plants in the control plot at the anthesis and grain filling stages, which resulted in a higher proportion of photosynthate being allocated to the shoots and an increased harvest index. Competitive ability was investigated using de Wit replacement series. There were no significant differences in shoot dry weight and grain yield between root pruned and control plots, but the root pruned wheat was less productive and had a lower relative yield compared with the control in the mixture field. The relative spike number of root pruned wheat decreased significantly in the mixture plots. Root pruned wheat had significantly higher dry mass per stem than control in the monoculture plot. In the mixture plot, the dry mass per stem of root pruned wheat tended to decrease with increase in plant density of the control wheat. The differences between root pruned and control wheat plants mentioned above showed that the competitive ability of root pruned wheat was lower than that of control wheat in mixture plots. It is an important result in this study that root pruning lowered water consumption significantly and improved the WUE of winter wheat. In conclusion, the current study showed that root pruning improved the WUE of winter wheat significantly by lowering the root biomass in the upper soil layer, which further demonstrated the speculation from different wheat cultivars that breeding of wheat varieties has unknowingly increased WUE and harvest index by reducing the root system size in the upper soil layer."}, "1198058": {"title": "Nitrogen and carbon\u00a0transformations, water use efficiency and ecosystem productivity in monocultures and wheat-bean intercropping systems", "abstract": "Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) and water use efficiency (WUE) are significant challenges in intensive wheat production.

WUE was greater for experiments with water limitation, probably because stomatal closure to restrict transpiration rate occurred around midday when vapor pressure deficit was highest.

Water was applied at five rates from 11% more to 23% less than evapotranspiration (ET) from a weighing lysimeter planted to the same crop. Equal quantities of water per irrigation were applied at 76 mm in the pre-emergence and the first postemergence irrigations and 102 mm in later irrigations. For a 102-mm application, an irrigation was scheduled whenever cumulative ET from the lysimeter reached 91, 102, 112, 122, and 132 mm of water, since the last scheduled irrigation for the treatments. Total amounts of 485 to 688 mm of water were applied in five to seven irrigations. Soil water content to 1.5 m decreased progressively with water applications below ET. The soil water content was determined gravimetrically before each irrigation and water use determined from differences in soil water content between irrigations plus the amount of applied water. Seasonal water use decreased progressively from 677 to 540 mm as irrigation frequency decreased, although water use in all treatments was similar for the first 120 days. Yields decreased as water applications decreased, except between the treatments equal to ET and at 10% below ET. At the three driest treatments yield decreased proportionately with water use, indicating that water use efficiency was not increased by restricting water use below ET from adequately watered wheat. A relationship between grain yield (Y), in g/m\u00b2, and water use (X), in mm water, was characterized by the expression: Y = \u22129548 + 46.42X \u2212 0.06866X\u00b2 + 0.00003390X\u00b3 (r = 0.98).

Plants headed 7 to 10 days earlier and matured 5 or 6 days earlier on the driest treatment than on the wettest treatments. Earlier maturity could have accounted for most of the differences in water use and total dry matter between treatments, although water stress was also important in the driest treatment.

Then, these two functions were used as multipliers to modify the first-order derivative of six distinct growth functions (i.e. Gompertz, Logistic, Mischerlich, Richards, Von Bertalanffy, and Weibull) to represent the elongation rate of wheat plant height under soil water stresses. Consequently, six modified simulation models for wheat plant height were established and identified as Mod-Geo, Mod-Log, Mod-Mis, Mod-Ric, Mod-Von, and Mod-Wei, respectively, among which an optimal simulation model was selected for winter wheat growth under soil water stresses. Based on experimental data of 2014\u20132015 used for model calibration, it was found that when Aw was greater than 0.65, elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content; when Aw was between 0.3 and 0.65, elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress; when Aw was less than 0.30, elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until Aw was close to 0 at which the elongation stopped. After that, the data of soil column experiment of 2014\u20132015 growing season were used to assess the parameters of the six newly established models. The results of model calibration showed that the mean value of the Willmott Index of Agreement (WIA) between measured and simulated wheat heights of the six cultivars were all less than 0.90 for all treatments in the experiment, except for the Mod-Log model (0.95). The data of soil column experiment in 2015\u20132016 seasons were used to validate the six calibrated new models. The results of model validation with mean value of WIA 0.93 which were even better than model calibration. Finally, the data of two growing seasons (2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014) of field experiments conducted under a giant rainout shelter were used for further verification of the six new models under field conditions.

In this study, based on experiments conducted in glass soil columns and field under rainout shelters in four years (2012-2016) in Yangling, Shaanxi Province in China, we attempted to establish a dynamic model for simulating leaf expansion and senescence of winter wheat under soil water stress. First, a temperature response function was established with four cardinal temperatures (base temperature, lower optimum temperature, higher optimum temperature, and maximum temperature). Then two soil water stress functions were established to quantify the effect of soil water stress on the processes of leaf expansion and leaf senescence of main stem per plant. The first order derivative of a logistic function was then modified with the temperature and soil water stress response function and was used to simulate the daily rate of leaf area expansion and senescence of main stem. The parameters of the new model were estimated using the Solver add-in in MS Excel and then validated based on the data of soil column experiments in 2014-2015 growing season. Then the new model was evaluated with another dataset of column experiments conducted in 2015-2016. Furthermore, the influence of soil water stress on wheat tillering was included in the new model based on open field experiments in 2012-2013 growing season.

A comparison was conducted between new LAI model and the original LAI module of CERES-Wheat. The results showed that the leaf expansion rate was not affected when the relative soil water availability was greater than 0.7; water stress inhibited the leaf expansion when relative soil water availability was between 0.2 and 0.7; leaves withered and yellowed when relative soil water availability was less than 0.2.

Water and radiation capture, biomass and grain production were measured for sole crops and intercrops.

On the other hand, resource productivity of sunflower\u2013soybean intercrop was higher than or similar to its corresponding sole crops. The improvement in water productivity for intercrop compared with soybean sole crop was accounted for by an increase in water capture efficiency and, also, by an increase in water use efficiency in the case of maize\u2013soybean intercrop. The increase in radiation productivity for maize\u2013soybean intercrop compared with soybean sole crop was the result of an increase in radiation use efficiency and of a minor but significant increase in radiation capture efficiency.

We propose that cropping intensification, based on wheat/soybean double cropping would (i) improve the annual water and radiation capture and productivity, and (ii) reduce unproductive water losses estimated on an annual basis. We tested these hypotheses through long term simulations (30 years), using DSSAT models locally calibrated and tested for wheat (W) (Triticum aestivum L.), soybean (S) (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) and maize (M) (Zea mays L.).

Across sequences, WUE and RUE were strongly associated. This correlation was involved in the link between water and radiation productivity. The increase in water productivity was related (P<0.0001) to a reduction in water loss, mainly accounted by runoff. In the long term, sequences with high intensification (ISI\u22651.5yr\u22121) had as high stability and productivity as traditional sequences of our region, based on wheat-summer crop with ISI=1yr\u22121.

The results indicated that, compared with bare soil, the average splash detachment rate under the canopy during corn growth was reduced from 77% to 43%, with an average of 68% approximately, while a soybean canopy can reduce the splash detachment rate from 77% to 48% with an average of 61% approximately during the growth stage. The splash erosion detachment rate increased significantly with increasing leaf area index and rainfall intensity. The throughfall was concentrated in the centers of rows as crop grows, and a sharp increase in the splash detachment rate was caused by concentrations of throughfall under the canopy, which resulted in uneven distribution of splash detachment. The spatial distributions of splash detachment depended on the spatial distributions of throughfall under the crop canopy. The change in throughfall intensity under the canopy was the main reason for the variation in splash detachment. The reduction of kinetic energy because of interception by the crop canopy contributed to a decrease in splash erosion.

Our results showed that wider-strips of soybean grown as 2M3S had significantly higher leaf area index (LAI; 19%), total dry matter accumulation (TDM; 15%), and grain yield (21%) than the narrower 2M2S strips; this is likely related to the reduced effects of maize shading on soybean.

Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017\u20132019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study.

Intercropping enhanced root length density (RLD) in both maize and soybean compared to the corresponding monocrop. RLD was higher and land equivalent ratio (LER) was lower under M2S2 than under other spatial arrangements of intercropping, WUE was higher in M4S2 than in other spatial arrangements. CONCLUSIONS: Intercropping was more efficient in using the environmental resources than monocropping. The M4S2 spatial arrangement in the maize-soybean intercropping could be selected because of its sustainability and greater land and water use efficiency."}, "6508501": {"title": "Variation among Soybean Cultivars in Mesophyll Conductance and Leaf Water Use Efficiency", "abstract": "Improving water use efficiency (WUE) may prove a useful way to adapt crop species to drought.

However, several examples are known where the linear relationship between cumulative intercepted radiation and biomass accumulation becomes uncoupled at some stage, with the latter declining by 21% in one reported case. This slowdown in growth is commonly referred to as the reduced growth phenomenon (RGP). In certain instances, this phenomenon appears to be related to the timing of crop initiation and harvesting. Summer-initiated sugarcane crops do not always resume expected growth rates after the transition from winter to spring, despite conditions being favourable for vigorous growth. Possible factors underlying the failure of sugarcane crops to realize full yield potential are reported and interrogated in this review. The potential involvement of lodging, flowering, and tiller mortality have been reviewed and the data suggest that, while such factors may contribute, they are unlikely to be the major causes of sugarcane RGPs. Similarly, reports indicate that temperature cannot account for reduced growth, as rates remain low despite the onset of favourable conditions in spring. In contrast, a decline in specific leaf nitrogen, potential initiation of sugar-mediated source-sink feedback inhibition of photosynthesis, and increased rates of maintenance respiration that occur during sugarcane development and maturation appear to be likely factors contributing to RGPs.

A modelling approach may be useful and even necessary for reasonable assessment of these traits across production environments with different and temporally variable levels of water availability. Earlier theoretical modelling using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Sugar module, found that traits affecting transpiration efficiency (TE) and water uptake by roots were important for improving sugarcane grown with highly variable rainfall. However, there were limitations of APSIM-Sugar in accommodating key physiological mechanisms, and this led to a revision of the APSIM-Sugar module described in this paper. Four key features were added to enable genetic variation in TE traits and root water supply (RWS) known to exist, to be modelled and assessed for predicted impact. These features were 1) the response of TE to water stress, 2) the midday flattening of hourly transpiration when plants are stressed, 3) conductance limits to hourly transpiration, which can apply even without stress and 4) the separation of soil hydraulic conductivity (k) and root length density (l) rather than the use of combined kl for determining RWS. A dataset of 182 observations of above ground biomass from 13 field experiments of sugarcane were used to check firstly that the new sugarcane module did not affect the simulation results when all the new features were disabled (model stability), secondly to check that the new features did not greatly reduce model performance, and thirdly, to determine the response or sensitivity of yields to the new features. Variation in parameter settings for the new features were based on the best evidence available for genetic variation in these traits, and were set before any testing against observations were made. With these features enabled in partial factorial combinations, the accuracy of the simulation of observed biomass, changed only to a minor extent compared to when no features were enabled. Separating k and l had the most consistent effect on improving model performance.Three additional published experiments with varying levels of imposed water stress were also simulated, with and without the new features. The simulation of biomass yield from two of the experiments was remarkably accurate regardless of which features were used in the simulation. Dry stalk yields reported for the third experiment were simulated accurately when no features were enabled and when midday flattening of transpiration was enabled and separate k and l enabled, one at a time. When a limit was placed on hourly transpiration, simulated TE and yield increased substantially when water was limiting but not in well-watered conditions; where yield was reduced.The new APSIM-Sugar features address the limitations of the original module (developed in 1999) for assessing water use related traits, including TE component traits and root growth. Effects of conductance on TE can now be simulated by limiting maximum hourly transpiration at the leaf level or k and specific root length at the root level. The new sugar module will also allow for better discrimination between sugarcane cultivars, now that vigour traits such leaf area development and radiation use efficiency are linked to root water uptake."}, "5335148": {"title": "Negative effects of lodging on irrigated sugarcane productivity\u2014An experimental and crop modelling assessment", "abstract": "Lodging lowers the productivity of sugarcane through a reduction in radiation use efficiency and stalk damage.

Field experiments with irrigated ratoon crops were conducted at Pongola, South Africa. In one treatment the cane in each plot was allowed to grow through bamboo frames that prevented lodging. In the other treatment, the cane was not supported and could lodge at any stage. The degree of lodging was captured weekly by a rating that ranged from 1 to 9, where 1=fully erect cane and 9=completely lodged cane.

The study showed that the onset of lodging was simulated reasonably well for various soil/crop/atmospheric conditions, while the extent of lodging at harvest was simulated very accurately for all crops. Simulated lodging was primarily driven by crop size and lodging events were triggered by rainfall that added weight to the aerial mass of the crop, and reduced the anchoring ability of the soil through saturation of the top soil.

Biomass and sucrose yields were simulated for 42 years to identify inter-annual variability in output sensitivities to 10 parameters that represent physiological traits and can be used to simulated differences between sugarcane cultivars.

Simulated sucrose yield was most sensitive to rue, sucrose_fraction (representing the fraction of biomass partitioned as sucrose in the stem) and green_leaf_no. However, climate and soil differences between regions changed the level of influence cultivar parameters had on simulation outputs. Specifically, model outputs were more sensitive to changes in the transp_eff_cf and kL parameters in the Burdekin region due to lower rainfall and poor simulated soil conditions. Collecting data on influential traits that are relatively simple to measure (e.g. number of green leaves) during cultivar development would greatly contribute to the simulation of new cultivars in crop models.

A literature survey revealed that 23 models have been developed or adapted for simulating the biomass of energy crops, including Miscanthus, switchgrass, maize, poplar, willow, sugarcane, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Three categories (radiation model, water-controlled crop model, and integrated model with biochemical and photosynthesis and respiration approaches) were addressed for the selected models according to different principles or approaches used to simulate biomass production processes. EPIC, ALMANAC, APSIM, ISAM, MISCANMOD, MISCANFOR, SILVA, DAYCENT, APEX and SWAT are radiation models based on a radiation use efficiency approach (RUE) with few empirical and statistical parameters. The AquaCrop model is a typical water-crop model that emphasizes crop water use, the expression of canopy cover, and the separation of evapotranspiration to soil evaporation and plant transpiration to drive crop growth. CANEGRO, 3PG, CropSyst and DSSAT are integrated models that use photosynthesis and respiration approaches. SECRETS, LPJmL, Agro-BGC, Agro-IBIS, and WIMOVAC/BioCro, DNDC, DRAINMOD-GRASS, and AgTEM are integrated models that use biochemical approaches. Integrated models are mainly mechanistic models or combined with functional models, which are dynamic with spatial and temporal patterns but with complex parameters and large amounts of input data. Energy crop models combined with process-based models, such as EPIC in SWAT and CANEGRO in DSSAT, provide good examples that consider the biophysical, socioeconomic, and environmental responses and address the sustainability and socioeconomic goals for energy crops. The use of models for energy crop productivity is increasing rapidly and encouraging; however, relevant databases, such as climate, land use/land cover, soil, topography, and management databases, are scarce.

E, G and GxE effects on RUEa were poorly predicted by all models, although data shortcomings (arising from uncertainty regarding date of primary shoot emergence and impacts of lodging) prevented us from making strong conclusions in this regard. Models accurately predicted G differences in RUEa during mid-season biomass sampling periods where data confidence was greater. Although the models were able to predict final ADM yield per G and per E reasonably well, none of the models predicted GxE interaction effects well. All models also under-estimated the variation in RUEa and ADM. Recommendations for experimental protocols for exploring RUEa are made.

The randomized block experiment was designed with four cropping patterns (sugarcane monocropping (MS), soybean monocropping (MB), sugarcane/soybean (1:1) intercropping (SB1), and sugarcane/soybean (1:2) intercropping (SB2)) and two rates of N fertilization (300kghm\u22122 (N1, reduced rate) and 525kghm\u22122 (N2, conventional rate)).

The cropping patterns and N applied rates had no significant effect on sugarcane yield. The soybean yield was influenced by different cropping patterns because of different planting densities (4, 8 and 16 rows of soybean were plant under SB1, SB2, and MB, respectively) and was adopted in this experiment. In addition, under the SB2 cropping pattern, the soybean yield at the reduced N application rate was higher than that at the conventional N application rate. Wricke\u2019s ecovalence (Wi2), the sustainable yield index (SYI) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were used to evaluate yield stability. Different treatments had no significant effects on sugarcane yield stability, as demonstrated by three indicators (Wi2, SYI and CV), which indicated that intercropping with soybean and reduced N rate had no effect on sugarcane yield. For soybeans, the value of Wi2 demonstrated that the stability of the intercropping system was higher than its counterpart monocropping system, as SYI and CV values indicated that SB2 had higher stability than SB1. During seven years of experiments, there was no significant difference in the soil fertility between MS and SB patterns. The soybean monocropping had a higher available K, pH and lower available P content than sugarcane inter- and mono-cropping. Different cropping patterns had a slight impact on N2O emissions and the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) value. Higher N input promoted N2O emissions and increased GHGI values. In conclusion, the present study observed that a 40% reduced nitrogen input combined with intercropping soybeans could maintain sugarcane yield and soil sustainable utilization, and that higher N fertilizer additions induced negative impacts on greenhouse gases emissions. Sugarcane intercropping with soybeans can reduce chemical fertilizer input and simultaneously maintain crop productivity; thus, it can be considered to be a reasonable practice for field management."}, "5631949": {"title": "Effect of agricultural management on N2O emissions in the Brazilian sugarcane yield", "abstract": "The expansion of sugarcane cultivation in Brazil for sugar and bioethanol production has led to increased N-fertilizer use.

Additionally, leaching of B was evaluated during 64\u00a0days of incubation using soil columns under controlled conditions. Results show that there was no interaction between B and Zn applications in sugarcane yield. Application of Zn showed residual effect by improving sugarcane yield in the second year; Zn also improved quality parameters of sugarcane (pol and fiber). In soils with adequate levels of available\u00a0Zn (>\u20091.2\u00a0mg\u00a0dm\u207b\u00b3), the rate of 3.9\u00a0kg\u00a0ha\u207b\u00b9 of Zn promoted the highest yields in the first ratoon. In opposite, B rates reduced sugarcane yield in the first and second ratoon, even under low B rates (1\u00a0kg\u00a0ha\u207b\u00b9). Leaching of B totaled 22% of applied B during 64\u00a0days of incubation. The finding is that Zn fertilization with zinc sulfate plays a key role in sugarcane yield, while B application in planting furrow using boric acid\u00a0should be replaced by a more integrated management of B, including different sources of B and methods of application."}, "6771627": {"title": "The Dynamics of Sugarcane and Sugar Yields in Florida: 1950\u20132018", "abstract": "Florida is the largest producer of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) in the United States.

Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions.

We used a large database collected from commercial sugarcane blocks to assess the effect of harvest time on SY and yield components. Blocks were first clustered based on similarity of climate and soil, referred as environments, and the effect of harvest season on SY, SFY, and POL%, as influenced by the environment and the number of harvests, was evaluated using analysis of variance. Harvest season strongly influenced POL% and SY but had a comparably smaller effect on SFY.

Through a two-year sugarcane field experiment, the data contribution to sugarcane soil-plant-atmosphere continuum simulation was quantified by assimilating soil water content (SWC) and LAI observations. Results demonstrated the importance of choosing appropriate data assimilation strategies. The forcing method failed to accurately simulate the temporal evolution of the soil moisture profile due to soil parameters not being updated, and the calibration method led to underestimated LAI before defoliation and overestimated LAI after defoliation. The EnKF method performed the best in estimating soil water content, LAI development, and sugarcane yield, as it reconciled simulation and observation uncertainties. The relative contribution of LAI and SWC data to yield estimation was dependent on water stress level.

The quantum yield for CO2 uptake decreased linearly with decreasing leaf N content. Genetic variation in quantum yield at a given level of N supply was also observed. Leaf tissue carbon isotope discrimination (delta) increased linearly with decreasing quantum yield. Concurrent determinations of the prevailing ratio of intercellular to ambient partial pressure of CO2 (p(i)/p(a)) during leaf gas exchange suggested that the observed variation in delta was almost entirely attributable to variation in bundle sheath leakiness to CO2 (phi) rather than p(i)/p(a).

Reduced partitioning of carboxylase activity to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase relative to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in N-deficient plants suggested that the associated increase in phi and decline in quantum yield may have been attributable largely to a decline in C3 cycle activity in the bundle sheath relative to C4 cycle activity in the mesophyll.

Agronomic practices such as the use of a crop residue layer, changed row spacing, growing suitable varieties and accurate irrigation scheduling could potentially increase water use efficiency (WUE) by saving water and/or increasing yield. The aim of the study was to investigate to what extent WUE of irrigated sugarcane production in SA can be improved by better agronomic practices, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in crop response to these factors.An overhead irrigated field experiment was conducted near Komatipoort, South Africa on a shallow, well-drained, sandy clay loam over a four year period (one plant (P) and three ratoon crops (R1, R2 and R3)). Treatments consisted of factorial combinations of variety (N14 and N26), row spacing (single rows spaced at 1.5m and dual rows spaced at 1.8m) and soil surface cover (bare soil and crop residue layer). Measurements included tiller population, interception of photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR), soil water content, and cane yield at harvest. Crop water use (CWU) was estimated using the water balance approach.This study showed that significant reductions in water use and irrigation requirements, and increases in WUE, are possible by using a crop residue layer to cover the soil. Water savings were largest in P (26% in CWU and 32% in irrigation requirement) but substantial savings were also achieved in R crops (about 15%). It is essential to practice accurate irrigation scheduling to realise these savings, taking into account soil cover and cultivar effects, especially during the period of partial canopy. Although the residue layer caused small reductions in yield in the P, R1 and R2 crops (on average 9%) these were not statistically significant. The combined effect of large CWU reductions and small changes in cane yield resulted in increased WUE (on average 18%).These responses to a residue layer were achieved through a reduced rate of canopy development due to delayed emergence of tillers, causing less green canopy cover and reduced CWU, especially during the period of partial canopy cover when stalk growth has not yet commenced. CWU and FIPAR were affected much less during the subsequent period of stalk growth, thus affecting cane yield minimally, provided irrigation scheduling was adjusted.Variety N14 consistently developed a canopy more rapidly, intercepted more radiation and achieved a higher yield than N26. Row configuration had a significant impact on canopy development, seasonal FIPAR, final stalk population but did not affect cane yield or WUE.The study produced quantitative data for parameterising crop models which will improve their reliability in irrigation management and yield prediction applications."}, "5571154": {"title": "Soil moisture tension effect on sugar cane growth and yield", "abstract": "An experimental plot was established in Campeche, M\u00e9xico, to assess the effect of moisture tension on sugarcane growth and yield.

In contrast, higher values of cane green virtual water were found at higher soil moisture tensions (Control treatment, 0.271m3kg\u22121).

We did not observe any change in sucrose content under controlled water deficits; however, the studied varieties showed different biomass partitioning: RB966928 had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks (0.59), while IAC5000 showed the lowest fraction (0.51). We verified that the harvest index for sucrose was not altered by reduced irrigation, but that its variability was attributed to the genotype inherited from traditional breeding programs.

A contributing factor to high wheat yields in Tasmania is the cool-temperate climate, which tends not to have extremes in temperature (cold, heat) as may be experienced in HRZ environments elsewhere. Hence an understanding of crop growth, development and yield of wheat of locally adapted wheat cultivars in Tasmania may improve our understanding of the basis of yield formation in other HRZ in Australia.

The baseline mineralisation of the SPN soil module was inspected with respect to the ability to predict both the observed plant N uptake and soil mineral N of the unfertilised plots.

The modified SPN was evaluated with respect to the whole range of mineral N and cattle slurry treatments. Nitrogen and biomass yields were successfully predicted. The dynamicity of the soil mineral N prediction was reasonable, but a statistical analysis of the model performance was hampered by the selective timing of the soil samples. The good fit of the time course of the plant N uptake under contrasting fertiliser treatments suggests that the predictions of soil N immobilisation and losses can also be assumed to be reasonable. The SPN model seems a suitable tool for the prediction of the effects of climate and management on the yield and on the soil-plant N economy of silage maize.

The photothermal quotient, Q (ratio between photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature) around the flowering period has been found to be a good predictor of grain number per unit area under potential growing conditions when both solar radiation and temperature vary, but not under suboptimal nitrogen (N) conditions. Under suboptimal conditions, Q might not account for differences in grain number due to modifications in radiation-use efficiency (RUE), biomass partitioning between vegetative and reproductive organs, fruiting efficiency, and/or a combination of these factors. This paper aims at providing insights into how grain yield is defined during the pre-heading phase in 2- and 6-row barleys under contrasting N and radiation environments, using a model proposed by RA Fischer for grain number determination. Nitrogen and radiation treatments affected grain number, and consequently grain yield, through changes in spike biomass at heading, and not by a direct N effect. When low and high N conditions were included, Q poorly explained variations in grain number. Nitrogen increased RUE during the pre-heading phase. When accumulated PAR intercepted between the maximum number of spikelet primordia and heading stages (PARia) was considered together with RUE, the accuracy of the model was increased. Nitrogen slightly increased biomass partitioning between reproductive and vegetative organs, but it was not strong enough to improve the model between PARia and grain number.

This has given rise to the concept of disease tolerance, with some crops exhibiting a smaller yield loss under a given severity of disease than others. Genetic improvement to minimise yield loss under disease is an attractive goal, as it exerts little or no selection pressure on pathogen populations, and could form a useful component of durable disease management programmes. However, progress towards this end requires a thorough understanding of the phenotypic traits that influence the response of yield to disease, their genetic control and the possible trade-offs involved with other desirable agronomic characteristics. This paper examines the candidate crop traits that may confer tolerance of foliar disease in wheat and barley and reviews evidence of genetic variation in their expression. In wheat grown under the relatively low light conditions of North-West Europe, post-anthesis source (assimilate supply) and grain sink capacity (capacity for dry matter accumulation) appear to be closely balanced. Traits associated with maintaining post-anthesis radiation interception and radiation use efficiency in spite of disease may confer tolerance. The most promising traits include a larger flag leaf and compensatory increases in photosynthetic rate in non-infected parts of leaves. In barley, yield is often more strongly sink limited, and early-season disease management is required to protect the formation of potential grain sites. A wider range of potential traits may influence tolerance including compensatory adjustments in leaf growth and morphology, and differences in the sensitivity of tiller and spikelet mortality to photoassimilate supply. Different methods for quantifying tolerance are suggested depending on the trait of interest."}, "5832513": {"title": "Designing future barley ideotypes using a crop model ensemble", "abstract": "Climate change and its associated higher frequency and severity of adverse weather events require genotypic adaptation. Process-based ecophysiological modelling offers a powerful means to better target and accelerate development of new crop cultivars. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important crop throughout the world, and a good model for study of the genetics of stress adaptation because many quantitative trait loci and candidate genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance have been identified in it. Here, we developed a new approach to design future crop ideotypes using an ensemble of eight barley simulation models (i.e. APSIM, CropSyst, HERMES, MCWLA, MONICA, SIMPLACE, SiriusQuality, and WOFOST), and applied it to design climate-resilient barley ideotypes for Boreal and Mediterranean climatic zones in Europe. The results showed that specific barley genotypes, represented by sets of cultivar parameters in the crop models, could be promising under future climate change conditions, resulting in increased yields and low inter-annual yield variability. In contrast, other genotypes could result in substantial yield declines. The most favorable climate-zone-specific barley ideotypes were further proposed, having combinations of several key genetic traits in terms of phenology, leaf growth, photosynthesis, drought tolerance, and grain formation. For both Boreal and Mediterranean climatic zones, barley ideotypes under future climatic conditions should have a longer reproductive growing period, lower leaf senescence rate, larger radiation use efficiency or maximum assimilation rate, and higher drought tolerance. Such characteristics can produce substantial positive impacts on yields under contrasting conditions. Moreover, barley ideotypes should have a low photoperiod and high vernalization sensitivity for the Boreal climatic zone; for the Mediterranean, in contrast, it should have a low photoperiod and low vernalization sensitivity. The drought-tolerance trait is more beneficial for the Mediterranean than for the Boreal climatic zone. Our study demonstrates a sound approach to design future barley ideotypes based on an ensemble of well-tested, diverse crop models and on integration of knowledge from multiple disciplines. The robustness of model-aided ideotypes design can be further enhanced by continuously improving crop models and enhancing information exchange between modellers, agro-meteorologists, geneticists, physiologists, and plant breeders."}, "5954938": {"title": "Ecosystem C and N dynamics affected by a modified spring barley trait with increased nitrogen use - a simulation case study", "abstract": "To what extent might a crop with increased plant N uptake efficiency and/or N demand increase plant biomass and soil carbon storage, decrease N leaching, and reduce the need for N fertilisation?

Understanding the mechanisms that promote stability in grain weight is important to ensure that efforts to increase grain number beyond current high levels successfully increase yield without compromising grain quality. The aims of this study were to establish 1) whether post-anthesis grain abortion contributes to the stability of grain weight by helping match grain numbers to post-anthesis assimilate supply and 2) whether variations in post-anthesis assimilation per unit grain number affect the heterogeneity of grain weight. Field experiments were conducted in a high-yield potential environment for spring barley in 2011 and 2012. Crops were either shaded post anthesis (a 59% reduction in radiation incident on the crop) to reduce net carbon assimilation or grown unshaded. Grain growth was measured at different spikelet locations on the ear and on different shoots (main shoot and tillers) of the same plant. Shading crops from 14 days after anthesis until harvest maturity reduced yield by 19\u201320%, mean grain weight (MGW) by 12\u201316% and harvest index by 5\u20136%, but did not significantly affect grain number in either year. The magnitudes of these effects were considerably lower than the reduction in radiation imposed by shading suggesting some compensatory adjustment in radiation use efficiency or dry matter partitioning to grain after shading. The rate of grain filling was higher for grains in central spikelets than grains at distal or basal locations on the ear. Shading reduced the rate of grain filling to a similar extent (23\u201327%) at most locations evaluated on the ear, but had no effect on the duration of grain filling. In spite of the comparable effects of shading on grain growth across different spikelet positions and hierarchy of shoots, crops harvested after shading tended to have a more variable individual grain weight (larger interquartile range and coefficient of variation) than crops that were unshaded. The results show that post-anthesis grain abortion does not contribute to the stability of MGW in spring barley.

Better targeting of fungicide applications, according to the likely response of the crop, would help improve the sustainability of disease management, but decision making is hindered by our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which fungicides influence crop yield. This study investigated possible mechanisms responsible for yield increases following fungicide treatment of spring barley with little or no visible disease. Field experiments conducted over six site-years in the UK quantified the effects of the protectant fungicide chlorothalonil (Chl), and systemic fungicides prothioconazole (Pro) and pyraclostrobin (Pyr), applied on their own or in combination. The severity of visible disease in the absence of fungicide treatments was minimised by growing varieties with good disease resistance. Contrasting fungicide chemistries led to different effects on yield. There were two components to the yield increases. The first involved an increase (4.3\u20137.5 %) in grain number m\u207b\u00b2 and was elicited by Pro and Pyr, but not Chl. The second was a smaller increase (3.7\u20134.6%) in mean grain weight (MGW) and was elicited by each of the fungicides tested. The effect of the triazole (Pro) and strobilurin (Pyr) on grain number was not the result of the control of visible disease pre-anthesis or an increase in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception. Nor was it the result of the control of asymptomatic pathogen infection or possibly leaf surface saprophytes, because Chl gave equivalent control without increasing grain number. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that triazoles and strobilurins can increase grain sink capacity through direct physiological effects in the field. These apparent physiological effects differ from those reported for wheat as they occur pre-anthesis and are not associated with delayed leaf senescence and resulting increased PAR interception. Application of Pro + Pyr increased radiation use efficiency (RUE), estimated over the whole season, by around 10 % compared to untreated controls and 6 % compared to Chl treated crops. Evidence is presented to show that whilst the average yield response to Pro + Pyr in the absence of disease was around 3 %, the response varied widely between sites and years. Where effects on grain number do occur, they can be elicited in a range of varieties by a single application made at booting. We argue that benefiting from physiological effects of triazole and strobilurin fungicides on spring barley yield, through appropriate timing of application, is compatible with strategies to target and reduce fungicide use in this crop."}, "7383207": {"title": "Early\u2010 And late\u2010waterlogging differentially affect the yield of wheat, barley, oilseed rape and field pea through changes in leaf area index, radiation interception and radiation use efficiency", "abstract": "Waterlogging is a severe stress that constrains crop production.

Water and nitrogen availabilities resulted in a wide range of water use efficiency (from 6.3 to 23kgg\u1d63\u2090\u1d62\u2099ha\u207b\u00b9mm\u207b\u00b9) and nitrogen use efficiency (from 2.9 to 31.8kgg\u1d63\u2090\u1d62\u2099kg\u2090\u1d65\u2090\u1d62\u2097\u2090b\u2097\u2091N \u207b\u00b9 in soil). Nitrogen uptake was closely and positively related to grain yield and total biomass at maturity for the three species. Nitrogen fertilization modified yield of the three species, mainly through changes in water use efficiency (R\u00b2=0.75). Differences between the species were low but existed in relative terms; they were not always in favor of barley. In fact, barley did not consistently outperform bread or durum wheat in terms of resource use or resource use efficiency under poor-yielding conditions. The relative differences between wheat and barley in terms of grain yield (analyzed as wheat yield/barley yield) were explained by the relative differences between them in terms of nitrogen use efficiency and water use efficiency (analyzed as wheat resource use efficiency/barley resource use efficiency)."}, "696832": {"title": "Yield performance and land-use efficiency of barley and faba bean mixed cropping in Ethiopian highlands", "abstract": "Mixed intercropping of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was compared with sole cropping for three growing seasons (2001-2003) at Holetta Agricultural Research Centre, in the central highlands of Ethiopia.

A randomised complete block design replicated four times was used. Mixed cropping and year effects were significant for seed and biomass yields of each crop species. Barley yield was reduced by mixed cropping only when the seed rate of faba bean exceeded 50 kg ha-1 or 25% of the sole seed rate. There was no mixed cropping by year interaction effect for barley grain yield but for faba bean seed yield. Total yield, barley yield equivalent, land equivalent ratio (LER) and system productivity index (SPI) of mixtures exceeded those of sole crops especially when faba bean seed rate in the mixture was increased to 75 kg ha-1 (37.5%) or more. The highest barley yield equivalent, SPI, crowding coefficient and LER were obtained when faba bean was mixed at a rate of 37.5% with full seed rate of barley. From this study, it is inferred that mixed intercropping of faba bean in normal barley culture at a density not less than 37.5% of the sole faba bean density may give better overall yield and income than sole culture of each crop species."}, "704042": {"title": "Volunteer Barley Interference in Spring Wheat Grown in a Zero-Tillage System", "abstract": "There is no published information on the impact of volunteer barley on wheat yield loss or on the economics of controlling barley with a herbicide.

Barley was seeded at different densities to simulate volunteer barley infestations. Regression analysis indicated that wheat-plant density influenced the effects of volunteer barley interference on wheat yield loss, economic threshold values, and volunteer barley fecundity among locations and years. Economic thresholds varied from as few volunteer barley plants as 3 m\u207b\u207b\u00b2 at Beaverlodge in 2003 and 2004 to 48 m\u207b\u207b\u00b2 at Lacombe in 2003. In most cases, wheat yield loss and volunteer barley fecundity were lower and economic thresholds were higher when wheat was seeded at the higher rate. For example, averaged over both years at Beaverlodge initial slope values (percentage of wheat yield loss at low barley density) were 4.5 and 1.7%%, and economic threshold values of volunteer barley plants were 3 m\u207b\u207b\u00b2 and 8 m\u207b\u207b\u00b2 at low and high wheat seeding rates, respectively.

Hand-harvested grain yields were either unaffected or reduced by ethephon, but combine-harvested yield tended to be increased by ethephon in 1989 when lodging was severe in untreated plots. Reductions in hand-harvested grain yield of ethephon-treated plots were primarily due to reductions in kernels per spike, which occurred in all 3 yr for barley grown at both plant densities. Ethephon increased spikes per plant for barley grown at both 100 and 300 plants m\u207b\u00b2 in 1987, which at the low plant density compensated for reductions in kernels per spike and kernel mass.

The crop canopy surface can be characterised by the Leaf Area Index (LAI). This index is used in precision farming for controlling the application rate in sensor-based fungicide spraying in cereal crops. For research purposes the LAI is measured using optical hand-held instruments. This method is not applicable in agricultural practice where rapid information about the LAI of the whole field is needed just before spraying. The CROP-Meter is a real-time sensor for measuring crop biomass density within cereal fields. The paper starts by analysing the correlation between the CROP-Meter records and LAI measurements obtained from hand-held optical instruments in farmers' cereal fields. The sensor signal (deflection angle) of the CROP-Meter showed good linear correlation with the reference LAI measurements (R \u00b2 values from 15 errors-in-variable regression analyses: 0.45-0.86). As the CROP-Meter sensor signal is correlated linearly with the LAI, this mechanical sensor can be used for controlling a field sprayer for variable rate fungicide spraying. The paper goes onto present a calibration routine for variable rate fungicide application for use in conjunction with a CROP-Meter controlled field sprayer: The standard dosage of fungicide is prepared with water in the tank of the field sprayer. This standard dosage (upper application rate) is applied uniformly along a typical tramline of the field, which is representative of the variability in plant biomass density. The upper and lower deflection angle measured along this tramline are then recalled from the working display of the on-board terminal. On the calibration display, the upper application rate is assigned to the upper deflection angle and the lower application rate is assigned to the lower deflection angle on the calibration display of the on-board terminal. The proportion of the lower and upper application rates depends on the range of LAI found in the field.The application rate is adapted linearly according to the deflection angle of the CROP-Meter. To define the routine at the on-board terminal the farmer has to decide on the minimum and maximum application rate. As the variability of the LAI occurring in heterogeneous fields is a criterion for choosing the minimum and maximum application rates, the third part of the paper discusses a simple deterministic model to determine the LAI in the field. This was based on the results from 46 errors-in-variable regression analyses of the functional relationship between the product of crop height (m) times number of tillers (m\u207b\u00b2) and the measured reference values of LAI. Crop height and the number of tillers were used as the only parameters for this model. The product of the two has to be divided by 100 to obtain an estimate of the LAI.

Estimation of LAI requires accurate modelling of leaf senescence. Many models use empirical turnover coefficients, the relative leaf-death rate determined from frequent field samplings, to describe senescence during growth. In this paper, we first derive a generic equation for nitrogen-determined photosynthetically active LAI (LAI(N)), and then describe a method of using this equation in crop growth models to predict leaf senescence. Based on the theory that leaf-nitrogen at different horizons of a canopy declines exponentially, LAI(N), which is counted from the top of the canopy to the depth at which leaf-nitrogen equals the minimum value for leaf photosynthesis, is calculated analytically as a function of canopy leaf-nitrogen content. At each time-step of crop growth modelling, LAI(N) is compared to an independent calculation of the non-nitrogen-limited LAI assuming no leaf death during that time-step (LAI(NLD)). In early stages, LAI(N) is higher than LAI(NLD); but with the advancement of crop growth, LAI(N) will become smaller than LAI(NLD). The difference between LAI(NLD) and LAI(N), whenever LAI(N) is smaller than LAI(NLD), gives the estimate of leaf area senesced at the time-step; the senesced leaf area divided by specific leaf area (SLA) gives the estimate of senesced leaf mass. The method was incorporated into two crop models and the models adequately accounted for the LAI observed in field experiments for rice and barley. The novel features of the approach are that: (1) it suggests a coherent, biologically reasonable picture of leaf senescence based on the link with photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen content; (2) it avoids the use of empirical leaf-turnover coefficients; (3) it avoids over-sensitivity of LAI prediction to SLA; and (4) it is presumably of sufficient generality as to be applicable to plant types other than crops.

Two experimental factors were included in the experiment in a factorial design: (1) catch crop (with and without), and (2) manure (with and without). The four-course crop rotation was spring barley undersown with grass/clover - grass/clover - winter wheat or wheat rye - pulse crop. All cuttings of the grass-clover were left on the soil as mulch. Animal manure was applied as slurry to the cereal crops in the rotation in rates corresponding to 40% of the N demand of the cereal crops. Application of 50kg NH\u2084-Nha\u207b\u00b9 in manure increased average wheat grain yield by 0.4-0.9MgDMha\u207b\u00b9, whereas the use of catch crops did not significantly affect yield. The use of catch crops interacts with other management factors, including row spacing and weed control, and this may have contributed to the negligible effects of catch crops. There was considerable variation in the amount of N (100-600kgNha\u207b\u00b9 year\u207b\u00b9) accumulated in the mulched grass-clover cuttings prior to ploughing and sowing of the winter wheat. This was reflected in grain yield and grain N uptake. Manure application to the cereals in the rotation reduced N accumulation in grass-clover at two of the locations, and this was estimated to have reduced grain yields by 0.1-0.2MgDMha\u207b\u00b9 depending on site. Model estimations showed that the average yield reduction from weeds varied from 0.1 to 0.2MgDMha\u207b\u00b9. The weed infestation was larger in the manure treatments, and this was estimated to have reduced the yield benefit of manure application by up to 0.1MgDMha\u207b\u00b9. Adjusting for these model-estimated side-effects resulted in wheat grain yields gains from manure application of 0.7-1.1MgDMha\u207b\u00b9. The apparent recovery efficiency of N in grains (N use efficiency, NUE) from NH\u2084-N in applied manure varied from 23% to 44%. The NUE in the winter cereals of N accumulated in grass-clover cuttings varied from 14% to 39% with the lowest value on the coarse sandy soil, most likely due to high rates of N leaching at this location. Both NUE and grain yield benefit in the winter cereals declined with increasing amounts of N accumulated in the grass-clover cuttings. The model-estimated benefit of increasing N input in grass-clover from 100 to 500kgNha\u207b\u00b9 varied from 0.8 to 2.0MgDMha\u207b\u00b9 between locations. This is a considerably smaller yield increase than obtained for manure application, and it suggests that the productivity in this system may be improved by removing the cuttings and applying the material to the cereals in the rotation, possibly after digestion in a biogas reactor. Cereal grain protein content was increased more by the N in the grass-clover than from manure application, probably due to different timing of N availability. Green-manure crops or manures with a relatively wide C:N ratio may therefore be critical for ensuring sufficiently high protein contents in high yielding winter wheat for bread making."}, "5852972": {"title": "Evaluation of trap crops for the management of wireworms in spring wheat in Montana", "abstract": "The polyphagous larvae of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae) are major pests of spring wheat in Montana, USA.

Salinity affected the durum wheat by reducing the grain and straw yields when the soil salinity (ECe) was higher than 5.8dSm\u207b\u00b9.

METHODS: Barley (Hordeum vulgare) was grown in hydroponic culture under three different levels of Mg supply (0.01, 0.1, 0.4\u00a0mM\u00a0Mg). WUE was determined on the leaf-level (leaf-WUE), the biomass-level (biomass-WUE) and via carbon isotope discrimination (\u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C). Additionally, concentrations of Mg, chlorophyll and H\u2082O\u2082, and the activities of three antioxidative enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase) in youngest fully expanded leaves were analyzed. RESULTS: Dry matter production was significantly decreased (by 34\u00a0% compared to control) in Mg deficient barley plants. Mg deficiency also markedly reduced leaf Mg concentrations and chlorophyll concentrations, but increased H\u2082O\u2082 concentrations (up to 55\u00a0% compared to control) and the activity of antioxidative enzymes. Severe Mg deficiency decreased biomass-WUE by 20\u00a0%, which was not reflected regarding leaf-WUE.

Our study suggests that biomass-WUE was not primarily affected by photosynthesis-related processes, but might be dependent on effects of Mg on night-time transpiration, respiration or root exudation."}, "5640562": {"title": "Crop residue incorporation can mitigate negative climate change impacts on crop yield and improve water use efficiency in a semiarid environment", "abstract": "Mitigation of the deleterious impacts of climate change on agriculture is a crucial strategy for securing food resources to meet the future demand of the world with a steadily increasing population. We used a pre-validated Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to explore the implementation of crop residue incorporation (RI) to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water use and crop yield for four winter crops at six sites in eastern Australia. Various residue management practices were simulated under current climate data and statistically downscaled climate data from 28 GCM simulations of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the period 1900\u20132100. The results showed that increasing future temperature shortened crop growth duration ranged from 7.4\u00b10.9days \u00b0C\u22121 for barley to 3.9\u00b11.9days \u00b0C\u22121 for canola. Under projected increases in the CO2 concentration and associated climate change, the overall average crop yield for 2021\u20132100 in eastern Australia without RI could change by \u221228\u00b15% for wheat, \u221222\u00b16% for barley, \u22126\u00b16% for canola and +7\u00b117% for chickpea relative to 1951\u20132000 yields. With RI, crop yields could be changed by +16\u00b114% for wheat, 11\u00b112% for barley and 7\u00b18% for canola and +9\u00b117% for chickpea. Further analysis showed that greater crop transpiration was the major advantage of RI. WUE in wheat and barley also increased significantly under RI due to reduced soil evaporation and surface runoff. This effect increased under future climate changes, but the effectiveness of RI varied by location. In general, the positive effects of RI on water balance and crop yield were higher at dry sites than at wet sites. Therefore, RI can be an effective adaptation option for mitigating the impacts of climate change on winter crops by improving WUE, but is more effective in narrow-leaf cropping systems in hot and dry environments."}, "5651791": {"title": "Yield, grain size, protein content and water use efficiency of null-LOX malt barley in a semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystem", "abstract": "The recent development of null-LOX barley (i.e. barley that is defective in the synthesis of two lipoxygenase enzymes, LOX-1 and LOX-2), which is oriented to produce a better quality beer, has increasingly drawn the attention of malt industry. However, the inhibition of LOX activity in such barley is raising concerns about the efficiency of its defense mechanisms to biotic and more specifically to abiotic stresses. A 2-year experiment was carried out in a typical Mediterranean environment of central southern Greece in order to: (i) explore the negative effect of drought on yield, yield components, grain size, grain protein content and water use efficiency in malt barley cultivars presenting a total loss of function of LOX-1 and LOX-2 activity, compared to a local malt barley cultivar having a full functional LOXs activity and (ii) introduce a new concept in water use efficiency, which focuses on the proportion of grains with acceptable size for malting, because according to malting industries one of the most limiting factors for the sustainable production of malt barley in the Mediterranean region is the inadequate grain size of malt barley, due to the frequent occurrence of terminal drought stress. The total loss of function of LOX-1 and LOX-2 activity did not cause any obvious advantage for the traditional malt barley cultivar over null-LOX cultivars, in terms of grain yield, yield components, grain size, grain protein content and water use efficiency. Increasing water availability with irrigation generally resulted in higher proportion of plump grains (>2.8mm) and lower proportion of thin grains (< 2.2mm), especially when water availability during the post-anthesis period was decreased and the temperature was increased. It was demonstrated that grain protein content of null-LOX cultivars was less responsive to soil water availability compared to grain size. Finally, it was shown that the new expressions of water use efficiency were able to discriminate the different adaptive responses of the studied barley cultivars to soil water availability."}, "5824871": {"title": "Do no-till and pig slurry application improve barley yield and water and nitrogen use efficiencies in rainfed Mediterranean conditions?", "abstract": "Tillage and N fertilization strategies including mineral and organic sources need to be studied in combination given their importance on the production cost that farmers face and their potential interaction on crop performance. A four-year (2010\u20132014) experiment based on barley monocropping was carried out in NE Spain in a typical rainfed Mediterranean area. Two tillage treatments (CT, conventional tillage; NT, no-tillage) and three rates of N fertilization (0; 75kgNha\u22121, applied at top-dressing; 150kgNha\u22121, applied at pre-sowing and at top-dressing at equal rate), with two types of fertilizers (ammonium-based mineral fertilizer and organic fertilizer with pig slurry), were compared in a randomized block design with three replications. Different soil (water and nitrate contents) and crop (above-ground biomass, grain yield, yield components and N concentration in biomass and grain) measurements were performed. Water- and nitrogen use efficiencies (WUE and NUE) as well as other N-related indexes (grain and above-ground biomass N uptake; NHI, nitrogen harvest index; NAR, apparent nitrogen recovery efficiency) were calculated. Barley above-ground biomass and grain yield were highly variable and depended on the rainfall received on each cropping season (ranging between 280mm and 537mm). Tillage and N fertilization treatments affected barley grain yields. No-tillage showed 1.0, 1.7 and 6.3 times greater grain yield than CT in three of the four cropping seasons as a result of the greater soil water storage until tillering. Water scarcity during the definition of the number of spikes per m2 under CT would have compromised the compensation mechanism of the other two yield components. Pig slurry application led to the same (3 of 4 years) or higher (1 of 4 years) grain yield than an equivalent rate of mineral N fertilizer. Regardless the N origin, barley yield did not respond to the application of 150kgNha\u22121 split between pre-sowing and top-dressing compared to the 75kgNha\u22121 rate applied as top-dressing. A significant nitrate accumulation in the soil over the experimental period was observed under CT. Greater barley water use efficiency for yield (WUEy), N uptake and grain N content were found under NT than CT in three of the four cropping seasons studied. Moreover, for a given N rate, the use of organic fertilization increased significantly the WUEy as an average of CT and NT. When CT was used, a greater NHI was observed when using pig slurry compared with mineral N as an average of the four years studied. However, the use of different N fertilization treatments (rates or types) under CT or NT did not increase the NUE compared with the control. Our study demonstrates that the use of NT and the application of agronomic rates of N as pig slurry leads to greater barley yield and water- and nitrogen-use efficiencies than the traditional management based on CT and mineral N fertilization."}, "6807681": {"title": "Modelling crop yield, water consumption, and water use efficiency for sustainable agroecosystem management", "abstract": "Agroecosystems provide food, energy, and essential services, while accounting for 80% of the world\u2019s total water use. Producing more food with limited water resources or improving water use efficiency (WUE) is an urgent task, especially in arid and semi-arid areas with fragile ecosystems and severe water shortages. This study integrated crop type distribution, irrigation data, remote sensing imagery, and meteorological factors to simulate the crop yield, water consumption, and WUE in the Heihe River Basin of China during 2007\u20132012. We found that variations in water consumption had little impact on crop yield because the value far exceeded the actual water requirement. From 2007 to 2012, the water consumption of corn increased by 11.24%, while its yield decreased by 0.63%. In contrast, the water consumptions of wheat, oilseed rape, and other crops decreased by 15.45%, 10.32%, and 4.61%, while their yields increased by 2.41%, 8.91%, and 1.13%, respectively. Consequently, the WUE of corn decreased by 10.68%, while that of oilseed rape, wheat, barley, and other crops increased by 21.44%, 21.13%, 4.96%, and 6.02%, respectively. The expansion of the area planted with corn led to a 3.36% increase in the WUE of the basin. However, this agricultural development is clearly unsustainable because it increased agricultural water consumption and decreased the ecological and domestic water supply. On-demand irrigation is therefore necessary to reduce water wastage and improve WUE. This would have reduced agricultural water consumption in 2007 and 2012 by 32.58% and 30.13%, and the WUEs would have increased by 48.33% and 43.12%, respectively.

Pre-plant soil water contents were significantly lower following a primary crop than after fallow. Consequently, water use and yield of secondary crops were <50 % of primary crops. Of 3-yr cropping sequences, RTF-WW-SB and RTF-WW-SC had the highest water use efficiencies with annualized yields generally approaching that of RTF-WW and SF-WW.

The results show that, with an efficient design, by means of irrigation tests, characterization of the plot, and the calculation of the optimal flow through an analytical formula, it was possible to reduce the irrigation times per hectare and the irrigation depth applied. Application efficiencies increased from 43% to 95%, while the WUE increased by 27, 38, and 47% for sorghum, barley, and corn, respectively.

For farmers to adopt this methodology, the following actions are required: (a) be aware that the water that comes from dams is as valuable as the water from wells; (b) increase the irrigation quota; (c) seek government support to increase the WUE; and (d) show them that with less water they can have better yields."}, "7260502": {"title": "Nitrogen fertilization strategies for improved Mediterranean rainfed wheat and barley performance and water and nitrogen use efficiency", "abstract": "Adequate fertilization strategies are paramount to fulfill increasing demands for food, feed and fiber while reducing environmental impacts.
